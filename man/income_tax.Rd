\title{Income tax payable}
\usage{
income_tax(income, fy.year = NULL, age = NULL,
  family_status = "individual", n_dependants = 0L, .dots.ATO = NULL,
  return.mode = c("numeric", "integer"), allow.forecasts = FALSE,
  .debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{income}{The individual assessable income.}

\item{fy.year}{The financial year in which the income was earned. Tax years 2000-01 to 2016-17 are provided, as well as the tax years 2017-18 to 2019-20, for convenience, under the assumption the 2017 Budget measures will pass. 
In particular, the tax payable is calculated under the assumption that the rate of the Medicare levy will rise to 2.5\% in the 2019-20 tax year.
If fy.year is not given, the current financial year is used by default.}

\item{age}{The individual's age. Ignored if \code{.dots.ATO} is provided (and contains
an age variable such as \code{age_range} or \code{Birth_year}).}

\item{family_status}{For Medicare and SAPTO purposes.}

\item{n_dependants}{An integer for the number of children of the taxpayer (for the purposes of the Medicare levy).}

\item{.dots.ATO}{A data.frame that contains additional information about the individual's circumstances, with columns the same as in the ATO sample files. If \code{.dots.ATO} is a \code{data.table}, I recommend you enclose it with \code{copy()}.

Age variables in \code{.dots.ATO} take precedence over \code{age} and providing both
is a warning.}

\item{return.mode}{The mode (numeric or integer) of the returned vector.}

\item{allow.forecasts}{should dates beyond 2019-20 be permitted? Currently, not permitted.}

\item{.debug}{(logical, default: \code{FALSE})  If \code{TRUE}, returns a \code{data.table} containing the components. (This argument and its result is liable to change in future versions, possibly without notice.)}
}
\value{
The total personal income tax payable.
}
\description{
Income tax payable
}
\details{
The function 'rolling' is inflexible by design. It is designed to guarantee the correct tax payable in a year.
For years preceding the introduction of SAPTO, the maximum offset is assumed to apply to those above pensionable age.

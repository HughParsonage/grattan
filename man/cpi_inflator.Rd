\title{CPI inflator}
\usage{
cpi_inflator(from_nominal_price = 1, from_fy, to_fy = "2014-15",
  adjustment = c("seasonal", "none", "trimmed.mean"),
  useABSConnection = FALSE, allow.projection = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{from_nominal_price}{(numeric) the price (or vector of prices) to be inflated}

\item{from_fy}{(character) a character vector with each element in the form "2012-13" representing the financial year contemporaneous to the from_nominal_price.}

\item{to_fy}{(character) a character vector with each element in the form "2012-13" representing the financial year that prices are to be inflated.}

\item{adjustment}{What CPI index to use ("none" = raw series, "seasonal", or "trimmed" [mean]).}

\item{useABSConnection}{Should the function connect with ABS.Stat via an SDMX connection? If \code{FALSE} (the default), a pre-prepared index table is used. This is much faster and more reliable (in terms of errors), though of course relies on the package maintainer to keep the tables up-to-date. The internal data was updated on 2017-08-16.}

\item{allow.projection}{Should projections beyond the ABS's data be allowed?}
}
\value{
The value of \code{from_nominal_price} in real (\code{to_fy}) dollars.

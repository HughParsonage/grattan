\arguments{
\item{.sample.file}{A data.table containing at least the variables \code{sample_file_1314} from the taxstats package.}

\item{colname_concessional}{The name for concessional contributions.}

\item{colname_div293_tax}{The name of the column containing the values of Division 293 tax payable for that taxpayer.}

\item{colname_new_Taxable_Income}{The name of the column containing the new Taxable Income.}

\item{div293_threshold}{The Division 293 threshold.}

\item{cap}{The cap on concessional contributions for all taxpayers if \code{age_based_cap} is FALSE, or for those below the age threshold otherwise.}

\item{cap2}{The cap on concessional contributions for those above the age threshold. No effect if \code{age_based_cap} is FALSE.}

\item{age_based_cap}{Is the cap on concessional contributions age-based?}

\item{cap2_age}{The age above which \code{cap2} applies.}

\item{ecc}{(logical) Should an excess concessional contributions charge be calculated? (Not implemented.)}

\item{use_other_contr}{Make a (poor) assumption that all 'Other contributions' (\code{MCS_Othr_Contr}) are concessional contributions. This may be a useful upper bound should such contributions be considered important.}

\item{scale_contr_match_ato}{(logical) Should concessional contributions be inflated to match aggregates in 2013-14? That is, should concessional contributions by multipled by \code{grattan:::super_contribution_inflator_1314}, which was defined to be: \deqn{\frac{\textrm{Total assessable contributions in SMSF and funds}}{\textrm{Total contributions in 2013-14 sample file}}}{Total assessable contributions in SMSF and funds / Total contributions in 2013-14 sample file.}.}

\item{.lambda}{Scalar weight applied to \code{concessional contributions}. \eqn{\lambda = 0} means no (extra) weight. \eqn{\lambda = 1} means contributions are inflated by the ratio of aggregates to the sample file's total. For \eqn{R = \textrm{actual} / \textrm{apparent}} then the contributions are scaled by \eqn{1 + \lambda(R - 1)}.}

\item{reweight_late_lodgers}{(logical) Should WEIGHT be inflated to account for late lodgers?}

\item{.mu}{Scalar weight for WEIGHT. (\eqn{w' = \mu w}) No effect if \code{reweight_late_lodgers} is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{impute_zero_concess_contr}{Should zero concessional contributions be imputed using salary?}

\item{.min.Sw.for.SG}{The minimum salary required for super guarantee to be imputed.}

\item{.SG_rate}{The super guarantee rate for imputation.}

\item{div293}{(logical) Should Division 293 tax be calculated? If FALSE, \code{.sample.file} is returned immediately, with a warning (that you're using this function pointlessly!).}

\item{warn_if_colnames_overwritten}{(logical) Issue a warning if the construction of helper columns will overwrite existing column names in \code{.sample.file}.}

\item{drop_helpers}{(logical) Should columns used in the calculation be dropped before the sample file is returned?}

\item{copyDT}{(logical) Should the data table be \code{copy()}d? If the action of this data table is being compared, possibly useful.}
}
\value{
A data table comprising the original sample file (\code{.sample.file}) with extra superannuation policy-relevant variables for the policy specified by the function.
}
\description{

\usage{
lf_inflator_fy(labour_force = 1, from_fy = NULL, to_fy = NULL,
  useABSConnection = FALSE, allow.projection = TRUE, use.month = 1L,
  forecast.series = c("mean", "upper", "lower", "custom"),
  forecast.level = 95, lf.series = NULL, .lf_indices = NULL,
  accelerate.above = 100000L)

lf_inflator(labour_force = 1, from_date = "2013-06-30", to_date,
  useABSConnection = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{labour_force}{A numeric vector.}

\item{from_fy, to_fy}{(character) a character vector with each element in the form "2012-13" representing the financial years between which the labour force inflator is desired.

If both \code{from_fy} and \code{to_fy} are \code{NULL} (the default), \code{from_fy} is set to the previous financial year and \code{to_fy} to the current financial year, with a warning. Setting only one is an error.}

\item{useABSConnection}{Should the function connect with ABS.Stat via an SDMX connection? If \code{FALSE} (the default), a pre-prepared index table is used. This is much faster and more reliable (in terms of errors), though of course relies on the package maintainer to keep the tables up-to-date.
The internal data was updated on 2018-11-12 to 2018-09-01.}

\item{allow.projection}{Logical. Should projections be allowed?}

\item{use.month}{An integer (corresponding to the output of \code{data.table::month}) representing the month of the series used for the inflation.}

\item{forecast.series}{Whether to use the forecast mean, or the upper or lower boundaries of the prediction intervals.}

\item{forecast.level}{The prediction interval to be used if \code{forecast.series} is \code{upper} or \code{lower}.}

\item{lf.series}{If \code{forecast.series = 'custom'}, a \code{data.table} with two variables, \code{fy_year} and \code{r}. 
The variable \code{fy_year} consists of all financial years between the last financial year in the (known) labour force series and \code{to_fy} \strong{inclusive}.
The variable \code{r} consists of rates of labour force growth assumed in each \code{fy_year}, which must be 1 in the first year (to connect with the original labour force series).}

\item{.lf_indices}{(Internal use only.) A \code{data.table} sent directly to \code{inflator} without any checks.}

\item{accelerate.above}{An integer setting the threshold for 'acceleration'. 
When the maximum length of the arguments exceeds this value, calculate each unique value individually 
then combine. Set to 100,000 as a rule of thumb beyond which calculation speeds benefit
dramatically. Can be set to \code{Inf} to disable acceleration.}

\item{from_date}{The date of \code{labour_force}.}

\item{to_date}{Dates as a character vector.}
}
\value{
The relative labour force between \code{to_date} and \code{for_date} or \code{to_fy} and \code{from_fy}, multiplied by \code{labour_force}.

\details{
\code{lf_inflator} is used on dates. The underlying data series is available every month.

#' CPI inflator when dates are nice
#' @param from_nominal_price (numeric) the nominal prices to be converted to a real price
#' @param from_qtr (date in quarters) the dates contemporaneous to the prices in from_nominal_price. Must be of the form "YYYY-Qq" e.g. "1066-Q2". Q1 = Mar, Q2 = Jun, Q3 = Sep, Q4 = Dec.
#' @param to_qtr (date in quarters) the date to be inflated to, where nominal price = real price. Must be of the form "YYYY-Qq" e.g. "1066-Q2".
#' @param adjustment Should there be an adjustment made to the index? Adjustments include 'none' (no adjustment), 'seasonal', or 'trimmed' [referring to trimmed mean]. By default, \code{seasonal}.
#' @param useABSConnection Should the function connect with ABS.Stat via an SDMX connection? By default set to \code{FALSE} in which case a pre-prepared index table is used. This is much faster and more reliable (in terms of errors), though of course relies on the package maintainer to keep the tables up-to-date.
#' The internal data was updated on 2018-11-12 to 2018-Q3
#' If using \code{useABSConnection = TRUE}, ensure you have \code{rsdmx (>= 0.5-10)} up-to-date.
#' @return A vector of real prices.
#' @export

#' Medicare levy
#' 
#' @description The (actual) amount payable for the Medicare levy.
#' 
#' @param income The taxable income. A vector of numeric values.
#' @param fy.year The financial year. A character vector satisfying \code{is.fy}.
#' @param Spouse_income The spouse's adjusted income.
#' @param sapto.eligible (logical) Is the taxpayer eligible for SAPTO? See Details.
#' @param sato Is the taxpayer eligible for the Senior Australians Tax Offset?
#' @param pto Is the taxpayer eligible for the Pensions Tax Offset?
#' @param family_status What is the taxpayer's family status: family or individual?
#' @param n_dependants Number of children dependant on the taxpayer.
#' @param .checks Should checks of certain arguments be made? Provided to improve performance when checks are not necessary.
#' @return The Medicare levy payable for that taxpayer.
#' @details The Medicare levy for individuals is imposed by the \emph{Medicare Levy Act 1986} (Cth).
#' The function only calculates the levy for individuals (not trusts).
#' It includes the s 7 \emph{Levy in cases of small incomes}, including the differences for those
#' eligible for \code{\link{sapto}}.
#' s 8 \emph{Amount of levy---person who has spouse or dependants} (though the number of dependants
#' is not a variable in the sample files).
#' 
#' The function does \strong{not} include the Medicare levy surcharge; it assumes that all 
#' persons (who would potentially be liable for it) avoided it.#' 
#' 
#' The Seniors and Pensioners Tax Offset was formed in 2012-13 as an amalgam of the Senior Australians Tax Offset and the Pensions Tax Offset. 
#' Medicare rates before 2012-13 were different based on these offsets. 
#' For most taxpayers, eligibility would be based on whether your age is over the pension age (currently 65).
#' If \code{sato} and \code{pto} are \code{NULL}, \code{sapto.eligible} stands for eligibility for the \code{sato} and not \code{pto}.
#' If \code{sato} or \code{pto} are not \code{NULL} for such years, only \code{sato} is currently considered. 
#' Supplying \code{pto} independently is currently a warning.

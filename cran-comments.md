NOTES:
  
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: ...
  ==> Spellings are correct: 'repos' and 'taxstats' cannot be quoted as they are within R code.

Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories: ...
  ==> Normal due to taxstats dependency

## Note to CRAN: moderately-large vignette
The vignette is quite lengthy and, while it will run on CRAN, requires the installation of 'taxstats', a 58 MB source package, each time the package is checked.

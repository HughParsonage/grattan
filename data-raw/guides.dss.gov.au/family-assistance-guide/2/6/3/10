<h1 >2.6.3.10 Eligibility Requirements for Up to 50 Hours CCB</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This topic explains the requirements of the work/training/study test when using approved care or registered care. An individual may be eligible to receive <a href="../../../acronyms#ccb" title="Child care benefit">CCB</a> for up to 50 hours per week of approved and/or registered care for each child if they satisfy the relevant work test, or an exception to the test.</p>
<p>This topic includes:</p>
<ul><li>the work/training/study test - approved care - CCB,</li>
<li>combining work/training/study commitments to satisfy the work test - approved care,</li>
<li>averaging hours of participation to satisfy the work test - approved care,</li>
<li>the work/training/study test - approved care prior to 3 July 2006,</li>
<li>the work/training/study test - registered care, and</li>
<li>exceptions to the work/training/study test - approved care and registered care.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> In this topic the 'work/training/study test' and 'work test' have the same meaning.</p>
<h2>The work/training/study test - approved care - CCB</h2>
<p>The following table shows the commitments that satisfy the work/training/study test for individuals using approved care. Any specific conditions that apply to a commitment are listed in the second column of the table. All commitments must coincide with the week CCB is claimed (<a href="../../../1/1/c/27">1.1.C.27</a>). Both the individual, and their partner (<a href="../../../1/1/p/30">1.1.P.30</a>) if they have one, must satisfy the test. Unless stated otherwise, activities must be undertaken for a minimum of 15 hours per week, or 30 hours per fortnight. The exceptions to the test are explained below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Commitment - CCB</th>
<th scope="col">Specific conditions</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Paid work or self-employment</td>
<td>
<ul><li>If the person is about to start work, this must occur within 14 days of claiming CCB for more than 24 hours per week.</li>
<li>Hours of paid work need not coincide with child care hours.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>Setting up a business</td>
<td> </td>
</tr><tr><td>Looking for work</td>
<td>A person is considered as looking for work if they are able to provide evidence of actively looking for work</td>
</tr><tr><td>Studying to improve work skills or employment prospects</td>
<td>Study commitments satisfy the work/training/study test when:
<ul><li>receiving:
<ul><li><a href="../../../acronyms#ya" title="Youth allowance">YA</a> and studying full-time, or</li>
<li><a href="../../../acronyms#austudy" title="Austudy payment">Austudy</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="../../../acronyms#pes" title="Pensioner education supplement">PES</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="../../../acronyms#abstudy" title="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Study Assistance Scheme">ABSTUDY</a>, or</li>
</ul></li>
<li>undertaking any other study to improve work skills or employment prospects.</li>
<li>Both contact and non-contact study hours are included.</li>
<li>Semester and vacation breaks throughout the duration of the study course are counted where the person intends continuing the study in the following semester (including the end of year/Christmas vacation, when the person intends continuing their study in the first semester of the new year).</li>
<li>Vacation breaks after the course of study has concluded are not included.</li>
<li>Lecture and tutorial times do not need to coincide with child care hours.</li>
<li>Contact hours do not need to match child care hours.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>Training to improve work skills or employment prospects</td>
<td>Training must improve work skills or employment prospects.<br />
				Semester and vacation breaks during the training course are included.<br />
				Vacation breaks after the training course has concluded are not included.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Voluntary work to improve work skills or employment prospects</td>
<td>Voluntary work must improve work skills or employment prospects.<br />
				Work hours need not coincide with child care hours.
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Catherine and her husband Peter volunteer at the Smith Family and will be dropping letters in people's mailboxes for 10 hours per week. As their volunteer work will not improve their work skills or employment prospects and totals less than 15 hours per week, or 30 hours per fortnight per person, their commitments do not satisfy the work/training/study test for approved care. If they were each volunteering for at least 15 hours per week, however, this would satisfy the test.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>A combination of work, training, study, looking for work or undertaking voluntary work to improve work skills/employment prospects.</td>
<td>A person may undertake a combination of the above activities such that the total number of hours undertaken must be a minimum of 15 hours per week, or 30 hours per fortnight.
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Soraya works as a receptionist every Wednesday and Thursday for a total of 12 hours, and is also studying a bookkeeping course for 4 hours every Wednesday night. As Soraya's total activities are more than 15 hours per week, she satisfies the work/training/study test.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>Voluntary work that does not improve work skills or employment prospects</td>
<td>To satisfy the work/training/study test voluntary work must be undertaken for a minimum of 15 hours per week, or a minimum of 30 hours per fortnight.<br />
				Voluntary work, which does not improve work skills or employment prospects, and is undertaken for less than 15 hours per week, or less than 30 hours per fortnight:
<ul><li>cannot be counted towards meeting the participation requirement, and</li>
<li>cannot be combined with other activities to meet the participation requirement.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Kath volunteers at the Red Cross and will be dropping letters in people's mailboxes for 16 hours per week. Even though her volunteering activity will not improve her work skills or employment prospects, because Kath is undertaking this voluntary work for at least 15 hours per week her commitments do satisfy the work/training/study test.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Tony works 8 hours per week, and also undertakes voluntary work, which does not improve his work skills or employment prospects, for 8 hours per week. Even though Tony's combined activities total at least 15 hours per week, Tony does not satisfy the work/training/study test because his voluntary activities cannot be counted towards satisfying the work/training/study test.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>Annual leave</td>
<td>
<ul><li>Annual leave, and purchased annual leave, both half pay and full pay.</li>
<li>Unpaid annual leave does not satisfy the work/training/study test.</li>
<li>Maximum of 25 days per calendar year.</li>
<li>If the regular working hours are less than 15 hours per week, or less than 30 hours per fortnight, and the person undertakes no other work related commitments and does not have an exemption, annual leave does not satisfy the work/training/study test.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>Sick leave</td>
<td>
<ul><li>Sick leave with pay for any period.</li>
<li>Maximum of 2 years leave for unpaid sick leave.</li>
<li>If regular working hours are less than 15 hours per week, or less than 30 hours per fortnight, and the person undertakes no other work related commitments and does not have an exemption, sick leave does not satisfy the work/training/study test.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>Long service leave</td>
<td>
<ul><li>Paid long service leave is counted.</li>
<li>If regular working hours are less than 15 hours per week, or less than 30 hours per fortnight, and the person undertakes no other work related commitment and does not have an exemption, long service leave does not satisfy the work/training/study test.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>Other paid leave</td>
<td>Leave granted under a State/Territory law, Industrial Award or Enterprise Agreement would satisfy the work/training/study test.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Paid or unpaid parental leave</td>
<td>Maximum of 12 months leave:
<ul><li>for a single parent (<a href="../../../1/1/p/10">1.1.P.10</a>), or</li>
<li>combined parental leave of both parents.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Kelly takes 52 weeks maternity leave without pay. Kelly's husband, Mark, is in full-time employment. Their commitments satisfy the work/training/study test for this period.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Kelly's regular working hours prior to maternity leave were less than 15 hours per week, or 30 hours per fortnight, and Kelly undertakes no other work related commitments and does not have an exemption, paid or unpaid parental leave does not satisfy the work/training/study test.</p>
</div>

</ul></td>
</tr></tbody></table><h2>Combining work/training/study commitments to satisfy the work test - approved care</h2>
<p>Any approved activity which, if undertaken for 15 hours per week, or 30 hours per fortnight, would satisfy the work/training/study test for approved care can, when undertaken for less than the required number of hours, be combined with other approved activities to satisfy the 15 hours per week or 30 hours per fortnight requirement.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Jane works 8 hours per week, and undertakes study to improve her work skills for a further 8 hours each week - Jane satisfies the work test as her total work/training/study commitments are at least 15 hours per week.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Exception: Voluntary work, which does not improve work skills or employment prospects and is undertaken for less than 15 hours per week or 30 hours per fortnight, cannot be combined with other activities to satisfy the work test. This activity must be undertaken for a minimum of 15 hours per week or 30 hours per fortnight to satisfy the work test.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> John works 8 hours per week, and also undertakes volunteering work, which does not provide work skills or improve his employment prospects, for 10 hours each week. Although John's combined commitments are at least 15 hours per week, he does not satisfy the work test. As John's voluntary work does not improve his work skills or employment prospects, these activities cannot be counted towards the required 15 hours recognised work or work related commitments for that week.</p>
</div>
<h2>Averaging hours of participation to satisfy the work test - approved care</h2>
<p>Individuals are able to average the number of hours of work, or work related commitments, they undertake in a fortnight to satisfy the work test for approved care.</p>
<p>When either the sole parent, or both parents, undertake 15 hours activity in a week, or a total of 30 hours activity in a fortnight (i.e. an average of 15 hours per week), they will satisfy the work test for the week concerned.</p>
<p>When determining the total number of hours activity undertaken in a fortnight, the activities undertaken in either the week preceding the relevant week, or the week following the relevant week, can be considered.</p>
<p>Averaging provisions do not apply for period greater than a fortnight.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Lina works as a casual sales assistant on a rotating roster- 24 hours one week, and 8 hours in the alternate weeks. As Lina's total fortnightly activities are at least 30 hours, she satisfies the approved care work test for both weeks in the fortnight.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Nathan works 5-hour shifts at the local pizza bar, working 3 shifts one week, and 2 shifts in the following week. Because Nathan's total fortnightly activities are less than 30 hours, he will only satisfy the approved care work test, and be eligible for up to 50 hours of CCB, in the week that he works 3 shifts (totalling 15 hours work). In the week Nathan works 2 shifts (totalling 10 hours work) he will only be eligible for up to 24 hours of CCB.</p>
</div>
<h2>Weekly &amp; fortnightly eligible hour scenarios</h2>
<p>The table below shows how the number of hours of work/training/study activity undertaken in a week can be combined with the number of hours activity in the previous or following week to determine a person's eligible hours limit.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person who works for less than 15 hours in week 1, but works more than 15 hours in week 2, and has a fortnightly total of at least 30 Hours, would be eligible for up to 50 hours CCB for both weeks.</p>

<p>Before 3 July 2006 the same work/training/study test applied to both approved and registered care.</p>
<p>Approved care past-period claims should be assessed using the work/training/study test that applied at the time the care was provided.</p>
<p>For approved care past-period claims for the 2004-05 and 2005-06 income years, the work/training/study test that applies is the work/training/study test that applies to registered care.</p>
<h2>The work/training/study test - registered care</h2>
<p>The following table shows the commitments that satisfy the work/training/study test for individuals using registered care. Any specific conditions that apply to a commitment are listed in the second column of the table. All commitments must coincide with the week CCB is claimed (<a href="../../../1/1/c/27">1.1.C.27</a>). Both the claimant, and their partner (<a href="../../../1/1/p/30">1.1.P.30</a>) if they have one, must satisfy the test. The exceptions to the test are explained below.</p>

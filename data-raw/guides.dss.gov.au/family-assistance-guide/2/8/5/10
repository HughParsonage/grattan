<h1 >2.8.5.10 JETCCFA Eligibility Requirements Relating to Hours</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This topic explains the new hourly limit that will apply to <a href="../../../acronyms#jetccfa" title="Jobs, education and training child care fee assistance">JETCCFA</a> payments, as well as the new limit on the number of hours for which JETCCFA will be paid per child, per week for some recipients (<a href="../../../1/1/j/50">1.1.J.50</a>).</p>
<h2>Hourly limit of JETCCFA</h2>
<p>From 3 July 2017, the maximum amount of JETCCFA that will be paid per hour of care is $8.40. If a person's child care service charges high hourly fees, JETCCFA will pay up to $8.40 per hour and the person will be liable for the remaining cost (subject to <a href="../../../acronyms#ccr" title="Child care rebate">CCR</a>).</p>
<h2>Weekly limit of JETCCFA hours</h2>
<p>A person's weekly limit of JETCCFA hours (<a href="../../../1/1/j/100">1.1.J.100</a>) for a child are the hours of care at person's nominated approved child care service or services that are required by the person to undertake approved JETCCFA activities (<a href="../../../1/1/j/30">1.1.J.30</a>) specified in their <a href="../../../acronyms#epp" title="Employment pathway plan">EPP</a>.</p>
<p>Hours of care at a person's nominated approved child care service is based on an allocation of 12 hours per day, regardless of child care service type. Therefore JETCCFA hours will always be granted in multiples of 12 hours per service type, i.e. 12, 24, 36, 48 or 60 hours (or more if required) per week. A service type may only use whatever portion of the 12 hours that can be attributed to the session of care on one particular day. The 12 hours approved cannot be taken over more than one session of care. Child care usage will be monitored to ensure there is no misuse of hours allocated. The multiples of 12 hours approved through <a href="../../../acronyms#dhs" title="Department of Human Services">DHS</a> will be converted to 'days' in the <a href="../../../acronyms#ccms" title="Child Care Management System">CCMS</a>.</p>
<p>Child care generally must not exceed 12 hours per day regardless of child care service type, for example, <a href="../../../acronyms#ldc" title="Long day care">LDC</a>, <a href="../../../acronyms#oshc" title="Outside school hours care">OSHC</a>, Vacation Care. There may be examples where there is a requirement for short term 24 hour approval. This is an exception to general guidelines and should be approved on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>The number of JETCCFA hours each child of an eligible person may receive are worked out separately for each of the person's children in approved child care.</p>
<h2>Limit for a person undertaking a study activity only</h2>
<p>From 5 January 2015, JETCCFA recipients undertaking a study activity ONLY, will be limited to 36 hours per week per child for JETCCFA.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the 36 hour weekly limit is for those parents undertaking a study activity only. A person who is undertaking a single JETCCFA approved activity other than study will still be able to access JETCCFA for more than 36 hours per week, up to the amount of hours they require and have been assessed eligible for. A person who is undertaking multiple JETCCFA activities (which could include studying) will also be unaffected by this new limit and can still receive up to 60 hours of JETCCFA if deemed eligible.</p>
<h2>Work, training, study test</h2>
<p>A person can receive JETCCFA for up to 24 hours of care per child per week, irrespective of their activity hours. To receive more than 24 hours of care per child per week (up to 50 hours) a person must undertake at least 15 hours of approved activity to qualify.</p>
<p>A person's JETCCFA hours for a child cannot exceed their eligible <a href="../../../acronyms#ccb" title="Child care benefit">CCB</a> hours in a week. For a situation where a person is approved for 5 days of JETCCFA for a particular care type, JETCCFA should be approved for 60 hours to account for sessional charging practices. In this situation, eligible CCB hours should be increased to 60 hours also, despite the person not meeting other increased eligible hour requirements.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These rules explicitly apply only to JETCCFA recipients for the purposes of JETCCFA, to assist recipients to enter or re-enter the workforce.</p>
<h2>Method - working out weekly limit of hours</h2>
<p>A child's weekly limit of hours is to be worked out in accordance with the steps 1 to 4 below.</p>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Identify the activities in the eligible person's EPP that are JETCCFA activities.</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Work out the number of days per service type required by the person to undertake these activities in accordance with their EPP (the person's 'activity related hours' (<a href="../../../1/1/a/12">1.1.A.12</a>)).</p>
<p>A person's activity related hours can also include:</p>
<ul><li>contact hours: the formal components of the activity, i.e. mandatory requirements of the course or training such as lectures, classes or training. For the purposes of correspondence courses (e.g. CENGAGE), official course hour allocations given by CENGAGE should be treated as contact hours for approval estimation purposes.</li>
<li>non-contact hours: for a person undertaking a course of study (<a href="../../../1/1/s/140">1.1.S.140</a>) or training (<a href="../../../1/1/t/55">1.1.T.55</a>), the time spent studying outside formal hours of instruction that the decision maker considers reasonable in relation to the person's course or training.</li>
<li>work-related commitments: if the person has work-related commitments requiring evening or night attendances, and no one else is available to look after the child, that person's time spent sleeping, up to a maximum of 12 hours a day.</li>
</ul><h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>From the number of activity days/hours, work out how many hours on a weekly basis the person's child will require approved child care while the person undertakes their activity related days (JETCCFA hours). Each day equates to a maximum of 12 hours of JETCCFA per day per service type, regardless of child care type and duration of the activity on the day, i.e. if the child attends care for part of the day, the number of hours approved for the whole day is included, up to 12 hours per day per service type.</p>
<p>The following should be taken into account:</p>
<ul><li>A person can receive JETCCFA for up to 24 hours of care per child per week, irrespective of their activity hours. In order for a person to receive more than 24 hours of care per child per week (up to 50 hours) a person must undertake at least 15 hours of approved activity to qualify.</li>
<li>A person who is undertaking a study activity only is limited to 36 hours of JETCCFA per child per week.</li>
<li>JETCCFA is paid for all hours in the session of care during which care may be provided to a child, not just for the hours of care the child attends.<br />
		A session of care is a period of time in which an approved child care service charges a fee for providing child care. A service type may only use whatever portion of the 12 hours that can be attributed to the session of care on one particular day. The 12 hours approved cannot be taken over more than one session of care. Child care usage will be monitored to ensure there is no misuse of hours allocated.
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong>A person requires LDC for their non school aged child on Tuesday and Wednesday from 9am to 5pm and Friday from 9am to 1pm while they work.<br />
				The person's child will be granted 3 days × 12 hours.<br />
				JETCCFA is granted 36 hours per week, specifically for LDC service type.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>If the child is being cared for by a person or organisation other than an approved service, or is attending school for some of the parent's activity related hours, then approved child care is not needed for those times.<br /><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2: </strong>The person has a child that attends school. The school the child attends operates from 9am to 3pm each day. The person will be studying during the school term on Mondays from 10am to 12pm, Tuesdays from 8.30am to 2pm and Wednesdays from 10am to 4pm. The person does not need approved child care for Mondays while the child is at school however requires Before School Care for Tuesdays and After School Care for Wednesdays.<br />
				The person's child will be granted 2 days × 12 hours (for the Tuesday and Wednesday).<br />
				JETCCFA is granted 24 hours per week, specifically for OSHC service type.<br />
				(Please note this example does not take into account any non-contact hours).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>If on a day a person is charged for a session (or sessions) of care of less than 12 hours in total, the hours allocated to JETCCFA, but not charged for that day, cannot be used or transferred to another day.<br />
		The approved child care service can only claim JETCCFA for the applicable standard period of care per day for their service type. The service may then use the JETCCFA allocation for that day up to the number of hours that the person is charged for that day, i.e. if a child attends a service that does not have approval for, or charge for a session of, 12 hours of care per day, the service cannot claim the full 12 hours of care per day.
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3: </strong>A person is training 4 days a week and requires their child to attend After School Care on all 4 days. The person's child will be granted 4 days × 12 hours. JETCCFA is granted 48 hours* per week, specifically for OSHC service type. (Please note this example does not take into account any non-contact hours).<br />
				* Although the JETCCFA hours granted is 48 hours per week, the standard approved period of care for After School Care is 3.5 hours per day, unless approved otherwise. The After School Care provider can only claim a maximum of 14 hours (4 days × 3.5 hours) JETCCFA for the week. The remaining hours cannot be transferred to another day.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul><h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Repeat steps 1 to 3 for each of the person's children for whom the person needs approved child care to support their JETCCFA activities.</p>

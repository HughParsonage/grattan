<h1 >2.8.3.40 JETCCFA Activity Limits for Study &amp; Training</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This topic explains the <a href="../../../acronyms#jetccfa" title="Jobs, education and training child care fee assistance">JETCCFA</a> activity approval limit for study and training.</p>
<h2>Approval limit</h2>
<p>A person undertaking study (<a href="../../../1/1/s/140">1.1.S.140</a>) or training (<a href="../../../1/1/t/55">1.1.T.55</a>) can be granted JETCCFA for only one block of 24 months (per qualification), or where the study or training is being undertaken part-time, for the part-time equivalent of up to 48 months.</p>
<p>Within the block of 24 months granted for a study activity, a person can transfer from a course that they have not completed to another course provided it is at the same level of study, however, this may only occur once. Exceptions may apply, as outlined below.</p>
<div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> A person commences study in a Bachelor of Social Work but after 8 weeks changes to a Bachelor of Nursing. The person can access the remaining portions of their 24 months of JETCCFA, i.e. 104 weeks minus 8 weeks, for their new course.</div>
<h2>Weekly limit to hours</h2>
<h3>Study activity only</h3>
<p>JETCCFA recipients undertaking a study activity only (or multiple study activities), are limited to 36 hours of JETCCFA per week, per child.</p>
<h3>Activities other than study</h3>
<p>A person who is undertaking a single JETCCFA approved activity other than study (e.g. job search or work), is able to access JETCCFA for more than 36 hours per week (up to 60 hours per week) if they require and have been assessed eligible.</p>
<h3>Multiple activities</h3>
<p>A person who is undertaking multiple JETCCFA activities, which could include one study activity (e.g. study and paid work), is able to access JETCCFA for more than 36 hours per week (up to 60 hours per week) if they require and have been assessed eligible.</p>
<h2>New activities</h2>
<p>For courses allocated to a particular level in the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), a person will only be able to enrol for an eligible course (i.e. Certificate II to Graduate Diploma level) that is a step-up, attainment wise, from a course they have studied previously. The course can only be at the same level if it leads toward an occupation in high demand as identified on the Skills Shortage List - Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This rule does not apply for courses that fall outside of the AQF (i.e. Senior Secondary Certificate, the <a href="../../../acronyms#amep" title="Adult Migrant English Programme">AMEP</a>, Skills for Education and Employment (SEE) and enabling courses).</p>
<h2>Exceptions to the study &amp; training activity limit</h2>
<h3><a href="https://docs.employment.gov.au/documents/skill-shortage-list-australia">Skills Shortage List - Australia</a></h3>
<p>The following rules apply in relation to the Skills Shortage List - Australia:</p>
<ul><li>If a qualification has been attained (i.e. completed) by a person then only the same level of study that leads towards an occupation as identified on the Skills Shortage List - Australia can be studied.</li>
<li>If a qualification has not been attained and a person still has portions of their initial 24 months JETCCFA remaining then a person can access JETCCFA for the remaining portions.</li>
<li>If a qualification has not been attained and the course does not lead towards an occupation as identified on the Skills Shortage List - Australia then a person is not JETCCFA eligible unless the course is at the vocational level Certificate II to Graduate Diploma level.</li>
</ul><h3>Skills for Education and Employment (SEE) &amp; AMEP</h3>
<p>For a person undertaking a course as part of identified pathways to improve their workforce abilities including courses under the SEE program and AMEP (where parents have school aged children who require out of school hours care), JETCCFA can be granted for between 26 weeks and 2 years. Where the activity is being undertaken part-time the part-time equivalent may be granted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> JETCCFA is not granted for participation in AMEP where the children are under school age, as the Department of Education and Training is responsible for administering the child care needs of participants. Where the children are school aged or over, and AMEP is not funding child care, JETCCFA may be granted.</p>
<h3>Teenage parents attending secondary education</h3>
<p>Teenage parents (i.e. a parent who is under 20 years of age) may be approved for JETCCFA for the entire period it takes to complete their secondary education (i.e. Year 12 or equivalent studies). This means that JETCCFA may be extended beyond the 24 month limit for study/training activity for those individuals.</p>
<p>Where a teenage parent will not complete their secondary studies before they turn 20 years old, JETCCFA may be extended to the end of the year in which they turn 20 years.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A 17 year old enters Year 10 and indicates they will be continuing studies until Year 12 (i.e. they turn 20 years during the course of Year 12). JETCCFA can be extended until the end of Year 12.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Teenage parents undertaking studies as part of the English as a second language - New Arrivals Programme (NAP) are 'undertaking secondary studies' and are therefore eligible for JETCCFA provided they meet the other eligibility requirements.</p>
<h3>Serious, extenuating or compelling circumstances</h3>
<p>A person should request a reassessment of their claim should they feel their circumstances apply. JETCCFA may be granted in extenuating circumstances once approval has been sought from the JETCCFA Program Manager in the Department of Education and Training. <a href="../../../acronyms#dhs" title="Department of Human Services">DHS</a> staff should request approval via DHS' National Office.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person commences a bachelor degree but after a semester finds the course level too difficult and changes to a lower level of study. The person does not hold any qualifications and wants to obtain a qualification to gain employment. The person can request reassessment of their JETCCFA based on compelling circumstances. If granted, the person can access the remaining portions of their 24 months JETCCFA, that is, 104 weeks minus 5 weeks, for their new course.</p>
</div>
<h3>Circumstances beyond a person's control</h3>
<p>Where circumstances beyond the person's control mean that they were not able to complete a semester or need to repeat part of their course, JETCCFA may be extended to cover the period lost due to those particular circumstances.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the person suffered a serious illness, or a close relative died.</p>
</div>
<h2>Grandfathering arrangements</h2>
<p>A person, who was eligible for JETCCFA prior to 9 May 2012, was grandfathered on previous JETCCFA study conditions and hours until they completed their current course of study or 30 December 2012, whichever came first. These arrangements have now ceased. From 31 December 2012, all JETCCFA recipients are subject to the current activity limits, unless a person meets one of the criteria in the exceptions to the study and training activity limit.</p>
<h2>Previous arrangements</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following arrangements are outlined for historical purposes only. These arrangements have now ceased.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2012 to 6 July 2015, a person residing in one of the 10 identified disadvantaged locations and participating in the Building Australia's Future Workforce (BAFW) targeted initiatives - Support for Jobless Families and Helping Young Parents measures were excluded from the new study and training limits that commenced 9 May 2012.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2008 to 8 May 2012, a person undertaking study or training that provided for specific workforce preparation outcomes could be granted JETCCFA for up to 24 months (or where the study or training was being undertaken part-time for the part-time equivalent of up to 48 months). Where a person had already completed their 24 months JETCCFA for a study or training activity they were not eligible for further JETCCFA for study or training, unless the person had completed an intervening activity other than job search and the study or training activity was not a continuation of an earlier activity that reached its approval limit.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008, JETCCFA was granted for courses of up to 12 months full-time duration, regardless of the length of the course that provided for specific workforce preparation outcomes.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007, JETCCFA was only granted for courses of up to 12 months full-time duration that provided for specific workforce preparation outcomes.</p>
<p>The activity limit for courses of study and training commenced prior to 1 July 2006 were assessed under the SJFA programme, which has now ceased.</p>

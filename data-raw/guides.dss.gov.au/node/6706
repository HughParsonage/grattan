<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section briefly describes:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ccr" title="Child care rebate">CCR</a> objectives,</li>
<li>CCR eligibility requirements,</li>
<li>CCR limits,</li>
<li>how CCR is paid,</li>
<li>CCR for individuals claiming <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ccb" title="Child care benefit">CCB</a> by fee reduction for 2008-09 onwards,</li>
<li>CCR for individuals claiming lump sum CCB,</li>
<li>payment arrangements of <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#cctr" title="Child care tax rebate">CCTR</a> for 2006-07 and 2007-08,</li>
<li>payment arrangements of CCTR for 2004-05 and 2005-06, and</li>
<li>background information.</li>
</ul><p>On 1 July 2009 CCTR was renamed CCR. The change of name is in recognition that the rebate is no longer a tax offset under taxation legislation but is paid to families under <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#fa" title="Family assistance">FA</a> law by Centrelink. There is no change to eligibility or entitlements.</p>
<h2>CCR objectives</h2>
<p>CCR aims to:</p>
<ul><li>assist families with the cost of approved child care,</li>
<li>provide incentives for families with dependent children to participate in the community, and</li>
<li>support parents in balancing work and family commitments.</li>
</ul><h2>CCR eligibility requirements</h2>
<p>An individual may be eligible for CCR if the individual:</p>
<ul><li>used approved child care (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/a/90">1.1.A.90</a>) during at least one week in the year,</li>
<li>was eligible for CCB (entitled at a rate of zero or more), and</li>
<li>the individual and partner (where applicable) met the CCR requirements of the work, training, study test for the week or, in the week, a weekly limit of hours applicable to the individual and the child was 50 hours, more than 50 hours or 24 hour care limit.</li>
</ul><p>To satisfy the work, training, study test for the CCR an individual and partner (where applicable) only needs to have a work, or work related commitment at some point during the week (i.e. no minimum number of hours is required), or to have an exemption from this requirement.</p>
<p>Families who are eligible for CCB, but whose CCB entitlement is zero due to income may still be eligible for the CCR.</p>
<p>CCR is not available for registered care (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/r/20">1.1.R.20</a>).</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h2>How CCR is paid</h2>
<p>Individuals can be paid their CCR (from July 2011) as a fortnightly payment of 50% of their out-of-pocket child care expenses for which they are liable, either directly to the individual's nominated bank account or to one or more approved child care service/s. Individuals may also still continue to receive their payment to a nominated bank account on a quarterly basis or as an annual lump sum.</p>
<p>Individuals can be paid their CCR (from 2008-09) as either a quarterly or annual payment lump sum, unless they nominate to receive the fortnightly payment option, of 50% of their out-of-pocket child care expenses, for which they are liable. CCR will be paid into the individual's nominated bank account.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 65EAAAA Individual may elect to have CCR paid in various ways, section 65EA Determination entitlement, or no entitlement, to CCR-eligibility for CCB by fee reduction, section 65EB Determining entitlement, or no entitlement, to CCR-eligibility for CCB for past period, section 65EC Later determinations of entitlement to CCR, section 65EAA Quarterly payments of CCR</p>
</div>
<h2>CCR for individuals claiming CCB by fee reduction for 2008-09 onwards</h2>
<p>From July 2011 the CCR can be paid on a fortnightly basis either directly to an individual's nominated bank account or to one or more approved child care service/s. Fortnightly payments will be paid once Centrelink has received child care attendance details from approved child care service/s and the CCB fee reductions have been calculated for the week (a more than nil amount or a nil amount due to income). For individuals in receipt of a nil amount of CCB, the full 50% CCR will be paid up to the annual limit. For individuals in receipt of a more than nil amount of CCB, Centrelink will withhold a reduction amount of 15% to provide a reserve to minimise an individual's debt that may be determined after the end of the income year. The reserve withheld will be reconciled at the end of the financial year and any outstanding amounts will be paid to the individual.</p>
<p>From 2008-09 the CCR can be paid on a quarterly basis or as an annual lump sum payment. Quarterly payments will be paid once Centrelink has received child care attendance details from approved child care service/s and CCB fee reductions have been calculated for the quarter (a more than nil amount or a nil amount due to income). The first 3 quarters will be paid based on an individual's CCB fee reduction amount, which is assessed using an estimate of income.</p>
<p>Payment of the last quarter of CCR will be 'held' until CCB reconciliation occurs. After the end of the income year, an individual's annual CCR entitlement will be determined after an individual's CCB entitlement is determined at reconciliation (when tax returns have been lodged and all child care attendance information has been received). Any quarterly payments made throughout the year will then be deducted from this actual entitlement and any remaining CCR will be paid (including any quarters not paid) to the individual or a debt raised if the individual has received too much CCR throughout the year.</p>

</div>
<h2>CCR for individuals claiming lump sum CCB</h2>
<p>Individuals who choose to claim their CCB as a lump sum payment can only receive their CCR as a lump sum payment after the end of the income year once their CCR eligibility is determined. This occurs after their lump sum claim for CCB has been determined.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From 1 July 2013 individuals have 12 months after the relevant financial year the child care was provided to lodge a lump sum claim for approved child care with Centrelink.</p>
<p>The 12 month lodgement timeframe may be extended if special circumstances exist up to the end of the year following the lodgement year.</p>

</div>
<h2>Payment arrangements of CCTR for 2006-07 &amp; 2007-08</h2>
<p>Individuals are paid their CCTR entitlement as a lump sum after the end of the income year for 30% of their out-of-pocket child care expenses, for which they are liable. After a usage statement has been provided by the approved child care service and the CCB entitlement has been determined, the CCTR entitlement will be determined and paid (if entitled) to the individual's nominated bank account.</p>

</div>
<h2>Background information</h2>
<p>The CCTR tax offset was introduced on 1 July 2004 for families and was administered by the <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a>. Those with a tax liability could offset this to the value of 30% of their out-of-pocket child care costs up to $4,000 per individual per child per year (indexed).</p>
<p>For the 2006-07 income year, and subsequent years, the CCTR was removed from the tax system to be delivered as a FA payment through Centrelink. All eligible working families, even those with low or no tax liability could receive the rebate.</p>
<p>From July 2008 until 30 June 2009, the CCTR increased to 50% of out-of-pocket child care costs up to $7,500 (indexed) per child per year for approved child care.</p>
<p>From July 2009 until 30 June 2010, CCR entitlement is calculated as 50% of out-of-pocket child care costs up to a limit of $7,778 (indexed) per child per year for approved child care. For the 2009-10 income year, and subsequent years, the CCTR was renamed the CCR.</p>
<p>From July 2010 until 30 June 2011, CCR entitlement is calculated as 50% of out-of-pocket child care costs up to a limit of $7,941 (indexed) per child year for approved child care.</p>
<p>For the income years 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14, CCR entitlement is calculated as 50% of out-of-pocket child care expenses up to a limit of $7,500 (capped) per child per year for approved child care. The annual indexation is paused for these 3 income years.</p>
<p>For the income years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, CCR entitlement is calculated as 50% of out-of-pocket child care expenses up to a limit of $7,500 (capped) per child per year for approved child care. The annual indexation is paused for a further 3 income years. The first indexation of the $7,500 maximum limit occurred on 1 July 2017.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter explains Centrelink internal review process and covers:</p>
<ul><li>initiating a review,</li>
<li>Centrelink initiated review,</li>
<li>date of effect of favourable decision for Centrelink initiated review,</li>
<li>reviews initiated by affected persons,</li>
<li>review relating to care percentage decisions - initiated by affected persons,</li>

<li>further requirement for review request relating to an income estimate,</li>
<li>continuation of payment during a review, and</li>
<li>notification of the decision.</li>
</ul><h2>Initiating a review</h2>
<p>An internal review can be initiated by:</p>
<ul><li>Centrelink (as a delegate of the Secretary), or</li>
<li>a person affected by a Centrelink decision.</li>
</ul><div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative, section 109A Review of certain decisions may be initiated by applicant</p>
</div>
<h2>Centrelink initiated review</h2>
<p>Centrelink may review an <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#fa" title="Family assistance">FA</a> decision where there is sufficient reason to do so. The decision maker may affirm, vary or set aside the original decision.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Reconciliation of entitlement is one example of a review initiated by Centrelink.</p>
</div>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative, section 104 Decisions that may be reviewed by the Secretary on own initiative</p>
</div>
<h2>Date of effect of favourable decision for Centrelink initiated review</h2>
<p>Generally, where the review is initiated by Centrelink, the date of effect of a review decision that is favourable to the person affected by the decision is the date from which full effect is given to the review decision (full arrears).</p>
<p>However, if the review decision:</p>
<ul><li>relates to:
<ul><li><a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a> by instalment,</li>
<li><a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#sbp" title="Stillborn baby payment">SBP</a> (paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test),</li>
<li>a weekly limit of hours (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ccb" title="Child care benefit">CCB</a>),</li>
<li>CCB %,</li>
<li>schooling (CCB) %, or</li>
<li>no entitlement to CCB by fee reduction, and</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the decision is made on a date later than 52 weeks after the person concerned was given notice of the original decision then the date that the review decision comes into effect is the later of:
<ul><li>the date from which full arrears are payable, or</li>
<li>1 July of the income year before the income year in which the review decision is made.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Centrelink can only initiate reviews for CCB on behalf of an individual and not on behalf of a child care service.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For decisions in all cases listed above, full arrears are payable as long as the review decision is made before the end of the income year following the income year in which the notice of the original decision was given. Otherwise, arrears can only be paid back to the beginning of the previous income year.</p>
</div>
<p>The limitation on the date of effect does not apply in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>Where a review of the decision was triggered by an income assessment by the <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a> (including FTB by instalment cases, or CCB by fee reduction), provided that the tax return was lodged on or before the end of the income year following the income year to which the assessment relates.<br /><div class="example">
<ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> For decisions relating to the individual's income, full arrears are payable where the tax return is lodged on or before the end of the next income year even if Centrelink does not make a review decision until after that income year.</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>Where the review decision is triggered by information that immunisation requirements have been met for a child for whom immunisation requirements apply during the income year to which the review relates, provided that the information is received before the end of the first income year after that income year.</li>
<li>Where the review decision is triggered by information that health check requirements have been met for a child who turned 4 years during the income year to which the review relates, provided that the information is received before the end of the first income year after that income year.</li>
<li>Where the review decision is triggered by information that the health check or immunisation requirement should not have applied for the income year to which the review relates.</li>
</ul><div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 107 Date of effect of certain decisions made under section 105</p>
</div>
<h2>Reviews initiated by affected persons</h2>
<p>Generally, a person affected by a decision made by an officer under FA law can request a review. The decision will be quality checked by a subject matter expert (SME) and if the person is not satisfied with the outcome they can request a review by an <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#aro" title="Authorised review officer">ARO</a>.</p>
<p>The ARO may affirm, vary or set aside the original decision.</p>
<h2>Review relating to care percentage decisions - initiated by affected individuals</h2>
<p>From 1 July 2010, changes to child support and FTB legislation align determinations about care between child support and FTB. This means where a care determination needs to be made in respect of a child, the determination can be made by either a delegate of the Child Support Registrar or the Secretary (CSA Act section 54K and FAAct section 35T).</p>
<p>Where either the Registrar or the Secretary conducts an internal review of a care decision, any new decision made on review will be used by both the Registrar and the Secretary. Where the AAT amends a decision or substitutes a new decision about a care percentage, that amended or substituted decision will be used by both the Registrar and the Secretary.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Where a care percentage decision has been made by Centrelink, this decision is applied to the child support assessment of the payee and the payer. Both the payee and the payer can approach either Child Support or Centrelink to seek review of the decision.</p>
</div>
<p>Where the care percentage decision has no effect under FA law (i.e. neither party is claiming FTB) only Child Support may make or review care percentage decisions. In such a case, if the individual approaches Centrelink to request the review, Child Support, as the original decision maker must undertake the review.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 109A Review of certain decisions may be initiated by applicant</p>
</div>
<h2>Time limit for a review initiated by affected persons</h2>
<p>Generally, an application for a review by a person in relation to FA should be lodged within 52 weeks after the individual is notified of the original decision. This time limit does not apply to FTB by instalment decisions, and some other decisions. However, there are time limits for full arrears to be payable depending upon the circumstances. (For more information, refer to 'Date of effect of a favourable decision for a review initiated by an affected individual'.)</p>

</div>
<h2 id="doefavourable">Date of effect of a favourable decision for a review initiated by an affected person</h2>
<p>Provided the person requests the review within the prescribed timeframe as described above, and the outcome of the review is in their favour, the decision takes effect from the date of the previous decision if:</p>
<ul><li>a previous decision is varied, or</li>
<li>a new decision is submitted.</li>
</ul><p>Arrears payable as a result of the review are backdated to the date of effect.</p>
<p>However, for a review decision relating to FTB by instalment, where the request for review is made more than 52 weeks after notice was given of the original decision, then the date of effect is generally the later of:</p>
<ul><li>the date from which full arrears are payable, or</li>
<li>1 July of the income year before the income year in which the review decision is made.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> For FTB by instalment cases, full arrears are payable as long as the review request is made before the end of the income year following the income year in which the notice of the original decision was given. Otherwise, arrears can only be paid back to the beginning of the previous income year.</p>
</div>
<p>This limitation on the date of effect does not apply where the request for review is the result of:</p>
<ul><li>an assessment or review of taxable income by the ATO, provided the application for review is made within 13 weeks of when the individual received notification of the ATO decision and the individual had lodged their tax return before the end of the income year after the income year to which the review relates, or</li>
<li>a review of child support entitlement, provided the person makes the application for review within 13 weeks of receiving notification of the revised child support assessment, or</li>
<li>immunisation requirements being met for a child for whom immunisation requirements apply during the income year to which the review relates, provided that the application for review is made before the end of the income year after that income year, or</li>
<li>health check requirements being met for a child who turned 4 years during the income year to which the review relates, provided that the application for review is made before the end of the income year after that income year, or</li>
<li>information that the health check or immunisation requirement should not have applied for the income year to which the review relates.</li>
</ul><div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 109E Date of effect of certain decisions relating to payment of FTB by instalment</p>
</div>
<h2>Further requirement for review request relating to an income estimate</h2>
<p>A request for a review of a decision in regard to eligibility for or entitlement to FA (other than SBP) or a CCB percentage to the extent that the decision was based on an estimate of the person's taxable income cannot be made until after the end of the income year and where the person is required to lodge a tax return, after the ATO has made an assessment of the person's taxable income for that year.</p>
<p>A request for a review of a decision in regard to eligibility for or entitlement to FTB to the extent that the decision was based on an estimate of maintenance income for an income year cannot be made until after the end of that income year.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This restriction only allows a review of a decision to the extent that it is based on an income estimate to occur after actual income is available so that correct entitlement can be determined.</p>
</div>
<p>This restriction does not preclude the person from providing a revised estimate of income at any time during the income year. If a revised estimate is provided and considered reasonable, the rate paid can be varied from the date the revised estimate is provided.</p>
<p>If an FTB instalment claim is rejected due to the income estimate being too high and the income estimate subsequently decreases, the person can lodge a new claim which contains a revised estimate and, if eligible, be paid prospectively from the date of the new claim. However, the individual will need to wait until their actual income is known to be paid for the past period (i.e. period from the date the first rejected claim is lodged up to the date the new claim is lodged).</p>
<p>Where a claim for SBP has been rejected because of the income estimate, the person's eligibility for each payment can be reviewed if they provide a revised estimate within 52 weeks of being notified of the rejection. The revised estimate must include the person's income and, if the person was partnered on the day the claim was initially lodged, the income of the person to whom they were partnered on the day the claim was lodged. This means that if the individual has separated since lodging the claim, their former partner's income for the 6 month income test period needs to be included in the revised estimate.</p>

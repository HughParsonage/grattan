<h1 >3.1.14.40 Work Bonus - Examples of Calculation of Assessable Employment Income &amp; Employment Income Concession Bank Balance</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This topic contains examples of the calculation of assessable employment income and the employment income concession bank balance under the work bonus arrangements that have applied from 1 July 2011.</p>
<p>The work bonus operates in addition to the pension income test free area. Assessable employment income is added to ordinary income when calculating a pension rate under the income test.</p>
<p>Information about calculating pension rates is at <a href="../guide-social-security-law/5/5/1">5.5.1</a>.</p>

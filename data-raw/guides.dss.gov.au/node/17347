<h1 >3.1.15.40 Work bonus - examples of calculation of income eligible for the work bonus &amp; work bonus income concession bank balance</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This topic contains examples of the calculation of assessable income eligible for the work bonus and the work bonus income concession bank balance under the work bonus arrangements that apply from 1 July 2019.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2019, the work bonus was expanded to include self-employment income from gainful work (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/g/25">1.1.G.25</a>), as well as employment income. The work bonus amount was also increased from $250 to $300 for each 14 day instalment period and the maximum work bonus income concession bank balance was increased from $6,500 to $7,800.</p>
<p>Information about calculating pension rates is at <a href="../guide-social-security-law/5/5/1.1">5.5.1</a>.</p>

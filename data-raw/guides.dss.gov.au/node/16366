<h1 >4.2.8.10 Dependent YA - Parental Income Test</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This topic covers the following matters:</p>
<ul><li>exemptions from the parental income test (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/p/40">1.1.P.40</a>),</li>
<li>determining whose income to include in the parental income test,</li>
<li>income assessed under the parental income test,</li>
<li>treatment of employer provided benefits under the parental income test,</li>
<li>parental income free area (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/p/30">1.1.P.30</a>), and</li>
<li>calculating the 'parental income test result' using the family pool.</li>
</ul><p>In order to calculate the 'reduction for parental income' (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/2/8/05">4.2.8.05</a>) dependent <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ya" title="Youth allowance">YA</a> recipients must have a parental income test result determined.</p>
<h2>Exemptions from the parental income test</h2>
<p>The parental income test does NOT apply to claimants/recipients whose parent/s:</p>
<ul><li>receive an income support payment, OR</li>
<li>are taken to be receiving (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/r/55">1.1.R.55</a>) their social security pension or benefit during an employment income nil rate period, OR</li>
<li>receive payment under the <cite>Farm Household Support Act 2014</cite>, OR</li>
<li>receive <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#abstudy" title="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Study Assistance Scheme">ABSTUDY</a> living allowance.</li>
</ul><p>If the YA claimant/recipient is exempt from the parental income test then the parental income test result for the YA claimant/recipient is nil.</p>

<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 5(1)-'parent', section 1067G-F3 Parent receiving Commonwealth benefit, section 1067G Module L Table of pensions, benefits, allowances and compensation, section 23(4A) Despite subsection (4)â¦, section 23(4AA) For the purposes of subsection (4A)â¦</p>
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../guide-social-security-law/3/1/12">3.1.12</a> Employment Income Nil Rate Period</p>
</div>
<h2>Determining whose income to include in the parental income test</h2>
<p>The parental income test is applied to the combined income of the parent/s or other relevant person/s that the claimant/recipient is wholly or substantially dependent upon.</p>
<p>If the dependent <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ya" title="Youth allowance">YA</a> claimant/recipient normally lives with a parent, and that parent has re-partnered, the partner's (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/p/85">1.1.P.85</a>) income is included in the combined parental income.</p>
<p>In the situation where a claimant/recipient's parents are separated the claimant/recipient (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/d/100">1.1.D.100</a>) nominates the parent with primary care responsibility.</p>
<p>If the YA claimant/recipient does NOT normally live with either parent and the parents are separated, the income of the parent with whom the YA claimant/recipient LAST lived is assessed. If that parent has re-partnered since the YA claimant/recipient LAST lived with the parent, the new partner's income is NOT included in the combined parental income, as the YA claimant/recipient does not normally live with the parent's new partner.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 5(1)-'parent'</p>
</div>
<h2>Income assessed under the parental income test</h2>
<p>Income assessed under the parental income test is combined parental income in the appropriate tax year (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/a/170">1.1.A.170</a>), usually the base tax year (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/b/10">1.1.B.10</a>). The base year is the tax year ending in the previous calendar year (i.e. for the 2016 assessment period the base year is 2014-15).</p>
<p>Current year assessments can be used when:</p>
<ul><li>the family's income is substantially less in the current tax year than in the base tax year, and</li>
<li>the decrease is likely to apply for AT LEAST 2 years from the date on which the event which led to the decrease occurred or first became apparent.</li>
</ul><p>The current tax year is the tax year immediately following the base tax year. For the 2016 assessment period the current tax year is 2015-16.</p>
<p>The concept of what constitutes 'substantially less income' is flexible. If an applicant's parental income has, or will, decrease enough for them to attract YA, or a higher rate of YA, the decrease may be accepted as substantial.</p>
<p>Current tax year is also used for the period 1 October to 31 December of an assessment year where parental income in the current year is at least 25% higher than income in the base year and at least 25% higher than the parental income free area.</p>
<p>The components of parental income are:</p>
<ul><li>taxable income, plus</li>
<li>adjusted employer provided benefits (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/e/90">1.1.E.90</a>) for the relevant tax year (see below Treatment of employer provided benefits under the parental income test), plus</li>
<li>target foreign income (see Note 1) based on the relevant Australian tax year, plus</li>
<li>total net investment losses (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/t/105">1.1.T.105</a>), plus</li>
<li>tax free pensions and benefits (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/t/26">1.1.T.26</a>) (see Note 2), plus</li>
<li>reportable superannuation contributions for the appropriate tax year (within the meaning of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A05138">Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</a>), less</li>
<li>maintenance amounts paid out.</li>
</ul><p>For the purposes of YA, a parent's taxable income for a tax year is the parent's most recent assessed taxable income for that year, which can be verified with an original or copy of the parent's taxation assessment made by the Commissioner of Taxation or amended by a Tribunal or Court.</p>
<p>If the parent does not have an assessed taxable income for that year, an estimate of taxable income may be accepted where it is considered reasonable, e.g. a copy of estimated income included in a tax return as lodged with the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of YA, a parent's taxable income must be a positive figure or $0. It cannot be a negative figure even where a person's taxable income is a taxable loss.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> See SSAct sections 10A(2)-'target foreign income', 1067G-F10 and 1067G-F11(3)-'target foreign income'.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> Prior to 1 July 2017, tax free pensions and benefits were not included for the parental income test.</p>

<h2>Treatment of employer provided benefits under the parental income test</h2>
<p>An employer provided benefit, also known as a 'reportable fringe benefit', is a benefit an employer provides to, or on behalf of, an employee for the employee's, or in some cases their family's, private use (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/e/90">1.1.E.90</a>).</p>
<p>The value of a person's adjusted employer provided benefits is included as a component of parental income and assessed under the parental income test.</p>
<p>From 1 January 2017 a person's adjusted employer provided benefits are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul><li>((Exempt employer reportable fringe benefits total Ã (1 â applicable fringe benefits tax rate)) + Non-exempt employer reportable fringe benefits total</li>
</ul><p>Exempt employer reportable fringe benefits are those where the person's employer is considered an 'exempt employer' under the <cite>Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986</cite> section 57A. Exempt employers include:</p>
<ul><li>registered public benevolent institutions,</li>
<li>registered health promotion charities,</li>
<li>some hospitals, and</li>
<li>some public ambulance services.</li>
</ul><p>As at 1 April 2017, the applicable <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#fbt" title="Fringe benefits tax">FBT</a> rate is 47%. This means that reportable fringe benefits amounts derived from an exempt employer are not fully counted under the parental income test.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The FBT year runs from 1 April to 31 March, with the FBT rate subject to change (refer to <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/fbt/">ATO FBT rates</a>). In the previous FBT year, the FBT rate was 49%.</p>
<p>Non-exempt employer fringe benefits are those where an employer is not considered exempt under section 57A. The full amount of reportable fringe benefits from a non-exempt employer is assessed under the parental income test.</p>
<p>It is possible that a person may have both exempt and non-exempt employer fringe benefits where they are employed by both exempt and non-exempt employers.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Employer provided benefits from exempt employer only</p>
<p>During the 2017-18 financial year Jane receives fringe benefits from an employer that meets the section 57A definition of an exempt employer. Her payment summary shows an employer provided benefit of $4,200.</p>

<h2>Parental income free area</h2>
<p>The parental income free area is the amount of income the parent can have without affecting the YA claimant/recipient's rate. If parental income is below or equal to the free area, parental income test result for the YA claimant/recipient is determined to be nil.</p>
<p>If parental income is ABOVE the parental income free area, the YA recipient's rate is reduced.</p>

<h2 id="calculatingreduction">Calculating the parental income test result (using the family pool)</h2>
<p>If combined parental income exceeds the parental income free area and the parents are not exempt from the parental income test then the parental income test result must be calculated.</p>
<p>The taper rate used to calculate the YA parental income test result is $0.20 for every $1.00 over the parental income test free area. However, to work out a claimant/recipient's individual parental income test result there is also a need to determine whether the claimant/recipient has parental income in common with another dependent young person aged under 22. This is so that the parental income test result for a claimant/recipient also takes into account that parental income would be used in the income tests for assistance provided to other members of the family (the family pool).</p>
<p>A claimant/recipient has parental income in common with another person where a parent of the recipient is also a parent of the other person/s and the YA, ABSTUDY or <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#aic" title="Assistance for Isolated Children">AIC</a> Scheme parental income test applies to the other person/s. A claimant/recipient can have parental income in common with a person who:</p>
<ul><li>is a claimant/recipient of dependent YA, or</li>
<li>is being paid dependent ABSTUDY living allowance, or</li>
<li>is being paid dependent ABSTUDY Group 2 school fees allowance (means-tested component), or</li>
<li>is being paid additional boarding allowance under AIC.</li>
</ul><p>A YA claimant/recipient also has parental income in common with a relevant sibling, i.e. an <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a> child or regular care child as defined in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999">FAAct</a> section 3, where a parent of the child is also a parent of the YA claimant/recipient.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The definition of FTB child and regular care child relate to the qualifying circumstances of the child and do not require a parent to actually have received or be receiving FTB for the child to meet either definition.</p>
<h3>Table 1: Calculating the parental income test result</h3>
<p>The following table shows the steps involved in calculating the parental income test result for a YA claimant/recipient (using the family pool).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The parental income test result is rounded to the nearest 10 cents.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Step</th>

<p>Does the combined parental income exceed the annual parental income free area?</p>
<ul><li>If NO, the parental income test result for the YA claimant/recipient is nil.</li>

<ul><li>a dependent YA claimant or recipient,</li>
<li>being paid dependent ABSTUDY living allowance,</li>
<li>being paid dependent ABSTUDY Group 2 school fees allowance (means-tested component), or</li>
<li>being paid additional boarding allowance under AIC.</li>
</ul><p>Work out the maximum fortnightly payment rate of each claimant/recipient of dependent YA and each person being paid dependent ABSTUDY living allowance. The maximum fortnightly payment rate is the sum of the following components (where applicable to the person):</p>
<ul><li>maximum basic rate,</li>
<li>energy supplement,</li>
<li>pharmaceutical allowance,</li>
<li>youth disability supplement,</li>
<li>rent assistance.</li>
</ul><p>Work out the maximum payment rate of each person being paid dependent ABSTUDY Group 2 school fees allowance (means-tested component) or additional boarding allowance under AIC. The maximum payment rate is the rate payable prior to the operation of the income test expressed as a fortnightly amount.</p>
<p>Add together the maximum fortnightly payment rates for claimants/recipients of the specified payments identified as having parental income in common with the claimant.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>7</td>
<td>
<p>Identify FTB children in the family with parental income in common with the claimant/recipient.</p>
<p>Work out the maximum rate of FTB Part A available to a parent in respect of relevant siblings of the claimant/recipient.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This only needs to be calculated for one parent in a couple as the same total rate is produced for both parents.</p>
<p>For most families the maximum rate of FTB Part A is the sum of the following components of FTB Part A available to the family, taking into account the shared care rate provisions, and before the operation of the maximum rate family income test:</p>
<ul><li>the standard rate of FTB Part A for each child,</li>
<li>FTB Part A supplement for each child (if parental income is under $80,000),</li>
<li>the annual amount of <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#es" title="Energy supplement">ES</a> for each child,</li>
<li>the newborn supplement for each eligible child,</li>
<li>multiple birth allowance,</li>
<li>rent assistance.</li>
</ul><p>Where the only relevant sibling is a regular care child the only component of FTB Part A included in the maximum rate of FTB Part A is the rate of <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ra" title="Rent assistance">RA</a> available to the family prior to the operation of the income test.</p>
<p>Multiply the maximum rate of FTB Part A by 14/365. This is the maximum fortnightly payment rate of FTB Part A.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is calculated once, regardless of how many relevant siblings there are, and then applied when working out the parental income test result for each YA claimant/recipient with parental income in common with those siblings.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Felix, 18, is a dependent YA recipient who earns no personal income. Felix lives at home with his mother and father whose combined income is $70,000 a year. Felix has parental income in common with his 19 year old brother (Joe) who is living away from home to study and who receives dependent YA (student), and his 12 year old sister (Anna) who is an FTB child who lives at home.</p>
<p>Felix's maximum fortnightly YA rate is $288.10</p>
<p>The parental income free area is $51,903.</p>
<p>As Felix's combined parental income ($70,000) exceeds the parental income free area ($51,903) the parental income test result is not nil and must be calculated (step 3).</p>
<p>To calculate Felix's parental income test result first the total fortnightly parental income test reduction amount must be as determined (at step 4 of Table 1):</p>
<ul><li>Parental income ($70,000) minus the current parental income free area ($51,903)<br />
			= the parental income excess ($18,097)</li>
<li>The parental income excess ($18,097) divided by 130<br />
			= $139.21. This is the total fortnightly parental income test reduction amount</li>
</ul><p>As Felix has parental income in common with his brother and sister, the family pool applies.</p>
<p>The family pool adds together the maximum fortnightly payment rates of each dependent child/young person in the family (Steps 6 to 8 in Table 1). For Felix's family this is:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th colspan="4">The Family Pool</th>
<th>Maximum rate totals</th>

<td>Maximum basic fortnightly YA away from home rate $437.50</td>
<td>Plus energy supplement: $7.00</td>
<td>Plus rent assistance : $130.60</td>
<td>$575.10</td>

<td>Maximum standard fortnightly FTB rate: $182.84</td>

<td>$214.20</td>
</tr><tr><td colspan="4">Family Pool Total<br />
					(the pooled total maximum fortnightly payment rate for all people who have parental income in common)</td>
<td>$1,082.00</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>Felix's share of the family pool has to now be calculated (step 9 of Table 1). To do this divide Felix's maximum fortnightly YA rate ($292.70) by the family pool total ($1,082) = 0.27</p>
<p>To calculate the parental income test result:</p>
<p>Multiply the total fortnightly parental income test reduction amount ($139.21) by Felix's share of the family pool (0.27)<br />
		= $37.60 (rounded to the nearest 10 cents). This is the parental income test result.</p>

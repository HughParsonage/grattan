<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This section provides general information about <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#fa" title="Family assistance">FA</a> debts (<a href="http://guides.dss.gov.au/family-assistance-guide/1/1/d/60">1.1.D.60</a>) including:</p>

<li>notice of debts.</li>
</ul><h2>Defining debt</h2>
<p>A person incurs an FA debt if they are paid an amount of FA:</p>
<ul><li>to which they were not entitled, or</li>
<li>that is more than the amount of assistance that should have been paid to the person under the FA law.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> Part 4 Division 2 Amounts recoverable under this Act, section 71(1) No entitlement to amount, section 71(2) Overpayment</p>
<h2>Debts due to the Commonwealth</h2>
<p>An overpayment of FA is a debt due to the Commonwealth if it is a debt under the:</p>
<ul><li><cite>A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999</cite>, or</li>
<li><cite>Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990</cite>.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 70 Debts due to the Commonwealth</p>
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> FA Guide <a href="../family-assistance-guide/7/1/2">7.1.2</a> FA Debts - Individuals &amp; ACOs, <a href="../family-assistance-guide/7/1/3">7.1.3</a> FA Debts - Approved Child Care Services</p>
</div>
<h2>Types of FA debts</h2>
<p>There are 4 main types of FA debts:</p>
<ul><li>Qualification debts: A debt that results from an individual receiving a payment for which they were not eligible.<br /><div class="example">
<ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> An individual receives FA and it is later determined through data-matching that they were not a resident of Australia and were therefore not qualified to receive the payment.</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>Circumstance debts: Debts that may result from changes in a person's circumstances.<br /><div class="example">
<ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> If there is a change in care arrangements for an <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a> child and the individual continues to receive payment on behalf of that child based on previous care arrangements, an overpayment may be incurred as a result of the change in the person's circumstances.</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>Reconciliation debts: Overpayments that result from an underestimation of family income. FTB and/or CCB individuals who receive payments as either fortnightly instalments or fee reduction usually paid on the basis of an estimate of <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ati" title="Adjusted taxable income">ATI</a> for an income (financial) year. The payment is reconciled at the end of the income year, after the individual and/or their partner have lodged an income tax return, if required to do so, and the returns have been assessed by the ATO. If an individual received more FTB and/or CCB than they were entitled to receive for that income year, they would incur a reconciliation debt. Reconciliation debts can also be raised for retrospective changes in circumstances.</li>
<li>Non-lodger debts: A non-lodger debt can occur where an FTB individual or their partner has not lodged an income tax return within the prescribed time. When an FTB individual receives FTB payments based on an estimated income and/or maintenance income during the income year and if they and/or their partner are required to lodge an income tax return for that year and they have not done so by 30 June of the lodgement year, the entire amount of FTB paid to them for the relevant income year may be raised as a non-lodger debt to the Commonwealth.</li>
</ul><h2>Identifying overpayments</h2>
<p>FA overpayments may be identified in the several ways including:</p>
<ul><li>through the end of year reconciliation process, or</li>
<li>by the individual (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/i/90">1.1.I.90</a>), <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#aco" title="Approved care organisation">ACO</a> or child care service notifying Centrelink that their circumstances have changed (see example 1), or</li>
<li>by compliance activities undertaken by Centrelink or the ATO (see example 2).</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The person advises of a change of circumstances several weeks after the event occurred.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Data-matching with other agencies such as the Department of Home Affairs.</p>
</div>
<p>Generally, an overpayment arises when an individual has been paid:</p>
<ul><li>FA when they were not eligible for the whole, or part of the period, or</li>
<li>more FA than they were entitled to receive.</li>
</ul><h2>Raising overpayments</h2>
<p>FA overpayments can be raised when there are changes in eligibility or changes in circumstances.</p>
<p>An overpayment due to eligibility that does not require verification of income details to accurately raise the overpayment is raised immediately and is not left until the reconciliation process.</p>
<p>Where available information suggests that changes in an individual's circumstance is likely to result in an overpayment, the overpayment should be raised immediately.</p>
<h2>Recovering overpayments</h2>
<p>If an overpayment of FA has been identified, and it is a debt due to the Commonwealth, the amount of the debt is normally recovered. For discussion on the various methods of debt recovery, refer to <a href="../family-assistance-guide/7/2">7.2</a>.</p>
<p>There are limited circumstances where recovery action for a debt is not taken, and the debt may be written off or waived. These are discussed in <a href="../family-assistance-guide/7/3">7.3</a>.</p>
<h2>Centrelink &amp; ATO responsibilities in relation to debts</h2>
<p>Centrelink is responsible for identifying, raising and recovering FA debts. This includes offsetting FA top-ups against FA debts.</p>
<p>The ATO will offset an available tax refund (of the individual and/or any consenting person) against any FTB debt to the extent of the available tax refund. Centrelink is responsible for recovering any remaining FTB debt after any tax refund has been applied to the debt.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> FA Guide <a href="../family-assistance-guide/7/2">7.2</a> Methods of Debt Recovery, <a href="../family-assistance-guide/7/3">7.3</a> Non-Recoverable Debts</p>
</div>
<h2>Recovery of debt from FTB individuals subject to non-payment of FTB based on an estimate</h2>
<p>All individuals who are subject to a prohibition on being paid FTB based on an estimate will continue to be subject to any existing debt recovery action for their FA debts (that may include a non-lodger debt), with the exception of mandatory withholding, which will cease for as long as the prohibition is in place.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Melissa is currently having $25 withheld from her fortnightly FTB instalment payments to repay an FA debt. Melissa becomes subject to a non-lodger decision resulting in a non-lodger debt and becomes subject to non-payment of FTB based on an estimate. Melissa's fortnightly instalment payments and her withholdings will cease, and new arrangements will need to be made to repay her FA debts.</p>

<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> FA Guide <a href="../family-assistance-guide/6/4/3/40">6.4.3.40</a> Non-payment of FTB Based on an Estimate</p>
</div>
<h2>CCB debts attributable to false or misleading statements</h2>
<p>If an amount of CCB is paid to an individual because of a false or misleading statement made by an approved child care service about <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#sccb" title="Special child care benefit">SCCB</a> certificates or about certain certificates relevant to weekly limit of hours (including for children at risk of serious abuse or neglect), the resulting overpayment is a debt owed by the service rather than the individual. Similarly, if an amount of CCB is paid to a service because of a false or misleading statement made by an individual in relation to their eligibility of SCCB, the resulting overpayment is a debt owed by the individual rather than the service.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00491" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999">FA(Admin)Act</a> section 71F Debts arising under more than one provision, section 71B Debts where no entitlement or where enrolment advance wrongly paid, section 71C Debts arising in respect of CCB where overpayment, section 71D Debt arising in respect of CCB where false or misleading statement by individual-debt owed by individual, section 71E Debt arising in respect of CCB when false or misleading statement etc. by service-debt owed by service</p>
</div>
<h2>Notice of debts</h2>
<p>If a debt due to the Commonwealth has not been paid in full, Centrelink must give the person a notice in respect of the debt.</p>
<p>The notice must specify:</p>
<ul><li>the date the notice was issued,</li>
<li>the reason for the debt,</li>
<li>the period to which the debt relates,</li>
<li>the debt amount,</li>
<li>the day the amount is due and payable, i.e. 28 days after the date of the notice,</li>
<li>that an interest charge may be applied to the debt if the person does not enter into a payment arrangement and make a payment under that arrangement,</li>
<li>that an interest charge may be applied to the debt if the person fails to comply with a payment arrangement or the payment arrangement is terminated,</li>
<li>payment options, and</li>
<li>contact details for enquiries concerning the debt.</li>
</ul><p>More than one notice may be issued in relation to a debt.</p>

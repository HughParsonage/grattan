<p>The member may commute part of the original income stream after the operative time. The family law provisions require that such commuted amounts be apportioned between the primary FLA and the secondary FLA in the percentages specified in the original 'percentage payment split'.</p>
<p>After the commutation is made, the new gross income amount must be obtained from the fund trustee for both the member (primary FLA) and non-member (secondary FLA). The NPP for each member and non-member must be reduced by his or her share of the commutation. This variation to NPP will mean that the deduction amount (and assessable income) for each member and non-member will also have to be adjusted.</p>
<h2 id="purchased">ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - assets test assessment</h2>
<p>Where income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 satisfy SSAct section 9A or 9B, they will receive a 50% assets test exemption unless they are granted relief as specified in <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/9/2/17">4.9.2.17</a>.</p>

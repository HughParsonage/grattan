<p>ATE income streams purchased prior to 20 September 2004 are eligible for a 100% asset test exemption. Therefore, no asset is assessed for ATE income streams purchased pre-20 September 2004.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h2>ATE income streams purchased pre-20 September 2004 - subsequent commutation made by member (income test assessment)</h2>
<p>The member may commute part of the original income stream after the operative time. The family law provisions require that such commuted amounts be apportioned between the primary FLA and the secondary FLA in the percentages specified in the original 'percentage payment split'.</p>
<p>After the commutation is made, the new gross income amount must be obtained from the fund trustee for both the member (primary FLA) and non-member (secondary FLA). The NPP for each member and non-member must be reduced by his or her share of the commutation. This variation to NPP will mean that the deduction amount (and assessable income) for each member and non-member will also have to be adjusted.</p>
<h2>ATE income stream purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - assets test assessment</h2>
<p>Where income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 satisfy SSAct section 9A or 9B, they will receive a 50% asset test exemption unless they are granted relief as specified in <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/9/2/17">4.9.2.17</a>.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h2>ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - subsequent reviews of primary &amp; secondary FLA income stream asset values</h2>
<p>As with income streams that are not subject to a divorce property split, the asset values for the member's primary FLA and the non-member's secondary FLA will need to be reassessed at 6 or 12 month intervals depending on whether the income stream payments are received either:</p>
<ul><li>once a year only (12 monthly intervals), or</li>
<li>2 or more times annually (6 monthly intervals).</li>
</ul><p>The first 6 (or 12) monthly interval for the new primary and/or secondary FLA income streams is dated from the previous review date for the original FLA, i.e. not the operative time when the payment split occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 the asset value of both member and non-member should be halved, (i.e. only 50% is assets test exempt).</p>
<h2>ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - subsequent commutations made by member (assets test assessment)</h2>
<p>The member may commute part of the original income stream after the operative time. The family law provisions require that such commuted amounts be apportioned between the primary FLA and the secondary FLA in the percentages resulting from the original percentage payment split.</p>
<p>The NPP for each member and non-member will be reduced by his or her share of the commutation, with consequent adjustments to the member's and non-member's asset value.</p>

<h2>ATE income streams purchased on or after 20 September 2004 - subsequent commutation made by member (income test assessment)</h2>
<p>The member may commute part of the original income stream after the operative time. The family law provisions require that such commuted amounts be apportioned between the primary FLA and the secondary FLA in the percentages specified in the original percentage payment split.</p>
<p>After the commutation is made, the new gross income amount must be obtained from the fund trustee for both the member (primary FLA) and non-member (secondary FLA). The NPP for each member and non-member must be reduced by his or her share of the commutation. This variation to NPP will mean that the deduction amount (and assessable income) for each member and non-member will also have to be adjusted.</p>

</ul><dl><dt id="australian_carer_payment">Australian Carer Payment/Carer Payment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Under the Agreement with Cyprus, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#cp" title="Carer payment">CP</a> can be paid only to the legally married partners of age or of severely disabled disability support pensioners. In all cases the partners must have been Australian residents at some time. When it is granted in Australia to the partner of an Agreement pensioner, it becomes payable under the Agreement.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="australian_disability_support_pension">Australian Disability Support Pension/Disability Support Pension</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Agreement with Cyprus covers <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#dsp" title="Disability support pension">DSP</a> for the severely disabled only. People who are not severely disabled cannot be granted an Australian DSP under the Agreement.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="australian_parenting_payment_(Single)">Australian Parenting Payment (Single)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Under the Agreement <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#pps" title="Parenting payment (single)">PPS</a> is limited to legal (de jure) widows. Other categories of lone parents (single parents, males etc) are not covered under this Agreement.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="australian_widow_b_Pension">Australian Widow B Pension</dt>
<dd>
<p>Under the Agreement, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#widb" title="Widow B pension">WidB</a> is limited to legal (de jure) widows. Other categories of widow B pensioners (divorcees, dependent females etc) are not covered under this Agreement.</p>
<p>A widow B pension must not be granted unless the woman's claim for the pension was lodged before 20 March 1997 and the woman is qualified for the pension before that day. This does not apply when the Secretary makes a determination to resume a woman's widow B pension under SSAct section 401 after it has been cancelled or suspended under sections 400, 400A or 400B. However, a woman on an autonomous widow B pension is still able to transfer to an agreement widow B pension overseas. In the latter situation, the transfer does not involve a new grant of widow B pension.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="australian_wife_pension">Australian Wife Pension</dt>
<dd>
<p>After 30 June 1995, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#wp" title="Wife pension">WP</a> cannot be granted, even under an agreement. An autonomous wife pensioner can transfer to an agreement WP (when an agreement covers this concurrent entitlement) as this is not classified as a 'new grant' of WP. WPs granted under the Agreement before 1 July 1995 continue to be paid outside Australia. WP can only be paid under the Agreement to a woman who has been an Australian resident at some time.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="benefit">Benefit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Benefit, for Australia, means a pension, benefit or allowance payable under Australian social security legislation as specified in Article 2 of the Agreement. It also includes any additional amount or increase that is payable to a person who qualifies for that increase. <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ra" title="Rent assistance">RA</a>, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#pha" title="Pharmaceutical allowance">PhA</a>, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#tal" title="Telephone allowance">TAL</a> and <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#raa" title="Remote area allowance">RAA</a> are payable to people inside Australia, but are subject to the portability restrictions of the SSAct for people outside Australia.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="bereavement_allowance">Bereavement Allowance</dt>
<dd>
<p>Under the Agreement with Cyprus, bereavement allowance can be paid only to widowed persons (male or female) who stop being partnered because of the death of their partner. It does not include someone who has a new partner.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="cypriot_age_pension">Cypriot Age Pension</dt>
<dd>
<p>Except for miners, Cypriot age pension is granted to both men and women aged 65 and there is no pre-condition that the claimant be retired from regular employment. Miners are entitled to age pension earlier than the normal qualifying age (if they are retired from mine work), receiving a discount of one month for every 5 months of work below ground. There are 2 contribution conditions for entitlement to an old age pension:</p>
<ul><li>the insured person must have paid contributions for at least 3 years, and</li>
<li>the average insurable earnings during working life must be greater than a prescribed level.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt id="cypriot_funeral_grant">Cypriot Funeral Grant</dt>
<dd>
<p>Funeral grant is a lump sum amount paid for the death of any person:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>who is in receipt of old age, invalidity, widow's benefit, death benefit or missing person's allowance,</li>
<li>who is an orphan in respect of whom orphan's benefit is payable,</li>
<li>whose death is caused by an industrial accident or occupational disease,</li>
<li>who satisfies the contribution conditions at the time of death, and</li>
<li>who is the dependant of a person in (a) or (d).</li>
</ol><p>The contribution conditions for funeral grant (mentioned in (d)) are that the deceased person has paid contributions for at least 26 weeks at any time or during the contribution year prior to death has paid or been credited with contributions for 20 weeks.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="cypriot_invalidity_and_work_related_disablement_pensions">Cypriot Invalidity and Work Related Disablement Pensions</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cypriot invalidity pension is paid to an insured person under age pension age who becomes permanently incapable for work. The claimant must have 3 years of contributions and a minimum level of earnings on which contributions have been paid or credited in the year prior to the onset of invalidity.</p>
<p>Cypriot work-related disablement pension is paid to any employed person who, as a result of an employment injury, suffers a loss of physical or mental ability to a degree of not less than 10%.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="cypriot_orphan's_benefit">Cypriot Orphan's Benefit</dt>

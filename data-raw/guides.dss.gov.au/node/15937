<p>This topic covers:</p>
<ul><li>delegation,</li>
<li>initial assessment,</li>
<li>annual reviews,</li>
<li>estimate or discretion review,</li>
<li>review of attribution percentages,</li>
<li>reassessment, and</li>

<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/12">4.12</a> Means Test Treatment of Private Trusts &amp; Private Companies from 01/01/2002, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/7/2">4.7.2</a> Assessing the Income &amp; Assets from Private Companies pre-01/01/2002, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/7/3">4.7.3</a> Assessing the Income &amp; Assets from Trusts pre-01/01/2002</p>
</div>
<h2>Delegation</h2>
<p>Only a <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#cao" title="Complex Assessments Officer">CAO</a> has the delegation to review attribution percentages, for example where there has been a structural change or change to those involved in the private trust or company. Other Centrelink assessors may undertake reviews of private trusts and companies, if the review involves only an update of assets and/or income.</p>
<h2>Initial assessment</h2>
<p>The means test treatment of private trusts and companies is explained in Chapter 4.12, which contains information about the attribution to individuals of the assets and income of private trusts and private companies from 1 January 2002. It provides detailed information on the attribution process and describes issues around deprivation of income and assets, the treatment of income from different sources and the treatment of various types of assets.</p>
<h2>Annual reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews of private trusts and companies are based on tax returns and financial statements. The initial annual review is manually recorded to coincide with the time the trust or company tax return is normally lodged with the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a>. Subsequent annual reviews are generated automatically by the system at this time each year.</p>
<p>The purpose of the annual review is to:</p>
<ul><li>update the assessment of the entity assets and income for attribution,</li>
<li>update the assets and income maintained for income support recipients in respect of their involvement in the company or trust, and</li>
<li>determine if the attribution percentages still reflect the current circumstances of the company or trust.</li>
</ul><p>A review of the assets and income of the company may involve a professionally qualified valuer's valuation of company or trust held assets including the home of the income support recipient.</p>
<p>A request for the current financial statements of the trust or company is sent out automatically. Income support recipients are requested to provide copies of all relevant documents at the appropriate time. If the documentation is not supplied, payment stops.</p>
<p>The table below shows contact for reviews and failure to respond processes.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Action</th>
<th scope="col">Method</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First phase</td>
<td>A request for financial statements is automatically issued to the nominated contact person for the trust or company. The contact person is asked to supply the statements within 28 days.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Second phase</td>
<td>If the first phase letter is not responded to within 35 days, a second request is sent to the nominated contact person. The contact person is again asked to supply the statements within 28 days. The controller/s and any current Centrelink income support recipients linked to the trust or company are also sent a letter stating that a review is in progress, that the initial request was not responded to by the nominated contact person and that a further request has been sent to the nominated contact person, who has 28 days to reply.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Third phase</td>
<td>A reminder letter is issued to the controller/s and to any income support recipients linked to the trust or company if no response is received within a further 35 days. This letter advises that income support recipient payments may be suspended if there is no reply within 28 days and will remain suspended until the review is complete.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Suspension</td>
<td>If no response is received within a final 35 days the income support recipient's payments/concessions are suspended and an advice sent. For income support recipients in residential care a manual follow-up is created.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Cancellation</td>
<td>A cancellation review is set for 13 weeks after suspension.</td>

<h2>Estimate or discretion review</h2>
<p>Where an estimate is used to determine the income support recipient's assessable income (as shown in <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/12/8/10">4.12.8.10</a>), or the CAO has exercised any form of discretion or made a determination contingent on certain circumstances, a review should be set for no more than 6 months from the date of assessment.</p>
<h2>Review of attribution percentages</h2>
<p>Only a CAO has the delegation to conduct a review where there is a structural change and a review of attribution percentages is required.</p>

<h2>Reassessment</h2>
<p>If the assets and/or income of the structure change, income support recipients may seek a review of assessments on the basis of a current and full set of financial statements and revised estimates of income. Circumstances that may warrant a reassessment of the assets and income of the entity at a time other than the annual review are discussed at <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/12/8/10">4.12.8.10</a>.</p>
<p>Attributable stakeholders are entitled to request not only a review of their own circumstances but also a reassessment of the assets and income of the private company at any time. Income support recipients who request a review of an entity's assessment must show just cause as to why this should occur. Where attribution percentages are being reviewed, income support recipients are asked to demonstrate why attribution should not apply, or why it should be reduced.</p>
<p>Reassessments are to be completed by a CAO. It is important to consider that the result of the reassessment will impact on all attributable stakeholders.</p>
<p>If the assets and income of the company are altered at a time other than the annual review, the CAO will determine the frequency of subsequent reviews until the company is returned to the annual review cycle. The reviews following an income support recipient's request for a reassessment of the company assets and income should not exceed 6 months. The CAO will determine when it is appropriate for the company.</p>

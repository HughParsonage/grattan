<dt id="netherlands'_general_old-age_pension-aow">Netherlands' General Old-Age Pension - AOW/General Old-Age Pension Act - AOW/General Old-Age Pension</dt>
<dd>
<p>A person (male and female) must be 65 years of age to qualify for AOW. A person qualifies on their 65th birthday provided they have been insured at any time. There is no minimum qualifying period.</p>
<p>AOW pensions are based on an insurance period of 50 years (from 15 to 65) for maximum pension. Insurance periods are periods of residence in the Netherlands or voluntary contributions paid while residing outside the Netherlands. The maximum rate of pension is linked to the Netherlands' net minimum wage. There is no relationship between the amount of contributions and the amount of pension received.</p>
<p>The maximum rate of AOW pension for:</p>
<ul><li>a couple, both pensioners, is 70% of the net minimum wage each,</li>
<li>a couple, one a pensioner and one a non-pensioner partner under 65 years of age, is 70% of the net minimum wage (in addition the pensioner may get partner supplementary allowance - AOW toeslag - to a maximum of 30% of the net minimum wage, based on the partner's insurance periods),</li>
<li>a single person is 70% of the net minimum wage, and</li>
<li>a single parent is 90% of the net minimum wage.</li>
</ul><p>Pensions are paid monthly with an additional holiday allowance accruing monthly and paid annually with the May payment.</p>
<p>The accrued holiday allowance is included in the monthly pension assessed by Centrelink.</p>
<p>Pensions are indexed in line with the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#cpi" title="Consumer price index">CPI</a> increase on 1 January and 1 July of each year.</p>

<dt id="netherlands'_general_old-age_pension-aow_transitional_arrangements">Netherlands' General Old-Age Pension - AOW transitional arrangements</dt>
<dd>
<p>When AOW started on 1 January 1957 it was recognised that it would be impossible for anyone already over 15 years to achieve maximum contributions of 50 years. Transitional arrangements allow these people to qualify for a full pension.</p>
<p>Under transitional arrangements, insured people are deemed to have been insured from their 15th birthday until 1 January 1957 provided they:</p>
<ul><li>are Dutch Nationals,</li>
<li>are resident in the Netherlands, and</li>
<li>have resided in the Netherlands for 6 years after reaching the age of 59.</li>
</ul><p>These deemed periods are called 'fictitious insurance periods'. The Agreement modifies the arrangements and allows Australian citizenship and Australian residence to be used as shown in the following example:</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A woman born on 2 April 1920 in the Netherlands emigrated to Australia on 2 May 1960. She was insured for the period 1 January 1957 to 2 May 1960, a period of 3 years and 5 months which is rounded up to 4 years. On reaching age 65 in 1985 she was entitled to an AOW pension of 8% (4 Ã 2%) of the maximum rate.</p>
</div>
<p>After the Agreement started on 1 April 1992, her residence in the Netherlands from her 15th birthday (1935) to 1 January 1957 (22 years) are now counted giving her an additional 44% (22 Ã 2%) pension. Her total AOW pension would then be 52% (8%+44%) of the maximum rate.</p>
<p>All residents of the Netherlands between age 15 and age 65 are liable to pay 14.30% of their income as contributions towards their AOW pension. There is a ceiling on the maximum contribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="netherlands'_general_surviving_relatives_act-anw">Netherlands' General Surviving Relatives Act - ANW/General Surviving Relatives Act - ANW/General Surviving Relatives Benefits</dt>
<dd>
<p>This Act came into effect on 1 July 1996. It provides entitlements to benefits for widows, widowers and dependent children who have lost one or both parents. The deceased spouse, partner or parent must have been insured under ANW on the date of his or her death.</p>
<p>ANW survivors' benefit is payable to the surviving relative if the relative:</p>
<ul><li>has an unmarried child under the age of 18 who does not belong to another's household, or</li>
<li>in incapacitated for work for at least 45%, or</li>
<li>was born before 1 January 1950.</li>
</ul><p>People taking care of a child that has lost its parents are entitled to ANW dependent child allowance. Children who have lost both parents are entitled to orphan's benefit.</p>
<p>Benefits are paid at statutory basic rates dependent upon the benefits being claimed. ANW survivors' benefit is also means tested.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="netherlands'_national_assistance_(algemene_bijstandswet)-abw">Netherlands' National Assistance (Algemene Bijstandswet) - ABW/Algemene Bijstandswet</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a means tested benefit for those in need. It is payable to a person who is not entitled to a general old-age pension (AOW) or whose AOW entitlement is insufficient to provide for their essential needs.</p>
<p>It is paid to Dutch Nationals and 'tolerated foreigners' living legally in the Netherlands who do not have enough income. It is not portable from the Netherlands. Australian pensioners living in the Netherlands can receive this benefit.</p>
<p>Payments are monthly at a standard rate determined by the person's age, marital status and living and domestic circumstances.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="netherlands'_period_of_insurance">Netherlands' Period of Insurance/Netherlands' Periods of Insurance</dt>
<dd>
<p>These are periods during which contributions were paid or were deemed to be paid under Netherlands' law (e.g. a period receiving Netherlands' sickness benefit would be deemed to be a 'period of insurance').</p>
</dd>
<dt id="netherlands'_self-employed_person's_disablement_benefits_act-waz">Netherlands' Self-employed Person's Disablement Benefits Act - WAZ/Self-employed Person's Disablement Benefits/Self-employed Person's Disablement Benefits Act - WAZ</dt>
<dd>
<p>This Act insures against the loss of income due to long term disablement. It covers self-employed people and those who have been handicapped from an early age. To be eligible a person must:</p>
<ul><li>be between 18 and 65 years of age,</li>
<li>have received income from or in connection with work in the year before becoming disabled (does not apply to people who are handicapped from an early age), and</li>
<li>have been at least 25% incapacitated for work for at least 52 weeks. However, claims under the Agreement require the applicant to be eligible for Australian <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#dsp" title="Disability support pension">DSP</a> as a severely disabled person.</li>
</ul><p>Benefits under WAZ are granted for a period of up to 5 years and the rate of benefits depends on the degree of incapacity for work and is based on a statutory amount called the basic amount (approximately equal to the gross minimum wage per months). If the WAZ benefit plus any other family income is less than the minimum guaranteed income, a supplementary benefit may be paid under the Supplementary Benefits Act (TW). <a href="18164#netherlands'_spouse_supplementary_allowance-aow_toeslag">Toeslag</a> may be payable.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="netherlands'_sickness_benefits_act-zw">Netherlands' Sickness Benefits Act - ZW/Sickness Benefits Act - ZW/Sickness Benefits</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sickness benefits are paid under this Act as a safety net payment for employees who do not or no longer have an employer due to their sickness. It is paid for the first 12 months of the sickness. After 52 weeks of sickness the employee falls under the Disablement Benefits Act - WAO. The rate of sickness benefit is usually 70% of the maximum daily pay of the employee.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="netherlands'_spouse_supplementary_allowance-aow_toeslag">Netherlands' Spouse Supplementary Allowance - AOW Toeslag/Old-age Spouse Supplement/Toeslag</dt>
<dd>
<p>A person getting AOW pension who has a partner under 65 years of age can get AOW toeslag. The allowance is paid to the AOW pensioner. When the partner reaches 65 years of age, the supplement is withdrawn and the partner is paid an AOW pension.</p>
<p>People granted AOW pension before 1 April 1988 with a partner under 65 were entitled to a pension based on a maximum of 50% of the net minimum wage plus AOW toeslag based on a maximum rate of 50% of the net minimum wage. Both payments were means test free, but an income test on the partner's income from, or in connection with, employment has been applied to AOW toeslag from 1 April 1991 where the partner was under 60 years of age.</p>
<p>People granted AOW pension from 1 April 1988 to 31 January 1994 with a partner under 65 were entitled to a pension based on a maximum rate of 70% of the net minimum wage plus AOW toeslag based on a maximum rate of 30% of the net minimum wage.</p>
<p>People granted AOW pension from 1 February 1994 with a partner under 65 are entitled to a pension based on a maximum of 50% of the net minimum wage plus AOW toeslag based on a maximum rate of 50% of the net minimum wage. An income test on the partner's income, from or in connection with employment, applies in respect of toeslag.</p>
<p>Under Article 20(1) of the Agreement, if an AOW pensioner resides in Australia and is entitled to receive AOW toeslag in respect of a partner, any Australian benefit the partner receives is to be disregarded under the AOW toeslag income test. Article 20(2) and 20(3) allows this concession to continue under prescribed circumstances if the person resides in a third country.</p>

<h2>Cessation of <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#eep" title="Employment entry payment">EEP</a></h2>
<p>Eligibility for EEP ceased 1 July 2008 as part of the 2008-09 Federal Budget. The following information is for historical information only.</p>
<p>Where employment starts on or after 1 July 2008, EEP will not be paid, unless a claim for an advance payment of EEP is made before 1 July 2008.</p>
<p>A person has at least 28 days to lodge a claim for EEP from the start of the employment in respect of which the claim is made. Some principal carer parents, partial capacity to work and <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#pp" title="Parenting payment">PP</a> recipients have 56 days from the start of their employment to lodge their claim. This means that EEP payments will be made up to 56 days after 1 July 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> John has a partial capacity to work and is receiving NSA. He has been receiving income support for over 12 months. John gains employment of at least 15 hours a week, which has lasted at least 4 weeks and is suitable employment, that is, paid at award wages. John has not received an EEP in the past 12 months. He is eligible for a $312 EEP after 4 weeks employment.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Pierre has a partial capacity to work and has been receiving NSA for 7 weeks. Pierre has been working part-time for about 4 hours a fortnight. He is offered extra hours of work that would increase his earnings to above the threshold amount for a period greater than 4 weeks. Pierre provides proof of the offer and, as he has not received an EEP in the past 12 months, he is eligible for a $312 EEP, even though he is not a long term income support recipient.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Emma is a partnered parent and has been receiving NSA for over 12 months when she gains employment of 15 hours per week at award wages. She has not received an EEP in the past 12 months. She is eligible for a $104 EEP when the work has continued for 4 consecutive weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Stephen is a single parent who received an EEP in July 2006 when he commenced suitable part-time work of 30 hours per fortnight as a teaching assistant during school terms. In August 2007 his hours of employment are increased to 32 per fortnight and he again claims an EEP. As his income is still below the threshold amount, he is not entitled to payment as he has received an EEP previously in respect of this employment. However, should his hours of work again increase, so that his income crosses the threshold amount, he would be entitled to another EEP in respect of his job as a teaching assistant.</p>

<h2>Early payment of EEP</h2>
<p>People who have entered an agreement under which they are to be employed full-time and will cease to be qualified for income support generally may be paid an EEP up to 14 days prior to commencing employment or receiving a rise in their income from employment.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Some people with a partial capacity to work may receive payment up to 28 days in advance of commencing employment (see table 2).</p>
<h2>Impact of working credit on timing of EEP</h2>
<p>Income support recipients who have a working credit balance remain qualified for their social security pension or benefit as this runs down their balance. This extended period of qualification does not affect the timing of the recipient's entitlement for an EEP.</p>
<p>This means that a person receiving NSA, MAA, PA or WA who starts full-time employment and is no longer eligible for payment will receive their EEP before running down their remaining working credit balance.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2008C00147" title="Social Security Act 1991, 26 May 2008 compilation">SSAct pre-1 July 2008</a> section 665AA Existence of working credit does not prevent payments under this part</p>

</div>
<h2>Employment qualification</h2>
<p>An NSA, YA (job seeker), MAA, PA or WA recipient's employment is verified:</p>
<ul><li>on a random sampling basis, or</li>
<li>at the time of claim, when EEP is claimed in advance, or</li>
<li>where the claimant is a <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#cdep" title="Community Development Employment Projects">CDEP</a> participant, with the CDEP grantee organisation in relation to the source of funding of top-up wages.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A person who enters a CDEP scheme as a CDEP scheme participant, does not become eligible for an EEP by taking up CDEP work. This is because work under a CDEP scheme paid from the CDEP wages funded component grant cannot be taken to be employment. This funding is paid to CDEP as an offset against income support payments.</p>
<p>However, a person who leaves a CDEP scheme for other employment, or a person who takes up employment of a CDEP that is paid for from the recurrent or other funding from the CDEP grantee organisation, can be paid an EEP under normal eligibility rules for the payment that they are receiving/qualified for.</p>
</div>
<p>The policy intent is that CDEP participants, receiving CDEP wages only, are to be treated as income support recipients, eligible for the range of supplementary assistance available to other income support recipients. They are not considered to be taking up 'employment' as such for the purposes of EEP payment. CDEP participants who are receiving top-up wages (in addition to CDEP wages) can be considered to be employed for EEP payment purposes.</p>
<h2>New enterprise incentive scheme</h2>
<p>An income support recipient who enters a <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#neis" title="New Enterprise Incentive Scheme">NEIS</a> scheme is eligible for an EEP. NEIS assists a person to start their own business. Participation in NEIS is accepted as employment.</p>
<p>An income support recipient who starts an employment based training program is NOT qualified for EEP.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A new work opportunities program or a special employer support program.</p>

<h2>Non-ongoing employment less than 12 weeks</h2>
<p>An NSA, MAA, PA or WA recipient who becomes employed is NOT required to CANCEL their current payment for 12 weeks where the employment is not expected to be ongoing in the long term.

</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Exception:</strong> A person does NOT qualify for EEP if they had received an EEP payment in the previous 12 months.</p>
<h2>Impact of working credit on timing of EEP where a person's income support payment remains current</h2>
<p>The timing of a person's EEP will not be affected by having a working credit balance. A recipient on NSA, YA (job seeker), MAA, PA or WA who remains current at zero rate will receive their EEP at the same point as if they did not have a working credit balance. That is, they will qualify for an EEP as per the table above.</p>
<p>The person will however, run down their working credit balance before becoming current at zero rate for 12 weeks.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An NSA recipient who starts casual work and has employment income high enough to make NSA no longer payable will first run down their working credit balance (against their employment income), and then enter into a 12 week employment income nil rate period, commencing from the end of the entitlement period in which their working credit balance is reduced to zero. If the work at the same or a higher level of income continues, NSA would be cancelled after the 12 week employment income nil rate period ends, and the person would then qualify for an EEP.</p>

<p>An NSA or YA (job seeker) recipient, in certain circumstances, (see tables 2 and 4), qualifies for EEP when their income increases from below the threshold amount to above the threshold amount. The threshold amount is the maximum amount of ordinary income an NSA recipient can receive without reducing their payment to nil if they:</p>

<li>are over 21 years but under 60 years of age, AND</li>

<h1 >3.1.1.50 FTB payments during absence from Australia before 1 July 2016</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From 1 July 2016, <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a> portability reduced from 56 weeks to 6 weeks. People who are absent from Australia (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/a/10">1.1.A.10</a>) prior to 1 July 2016 retain the previous 56 weeks portability arrangements (or part thereof remaining) until they return to Australia (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/a/120">1.1.A.120</a>) for 6 weeks or more. All subsequent trips will be subject to the 6 week portability rules.</p>
<p>For information about FTB portability where the individual or children depart Australia on or after 1 July 2016 refer to <a href="../family-assistance-guide/2/1/2/40">2.1.2.40</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This topic provides information about the rate of FTB payable when an individual or their FTB child or regular care child leaves Australia before 1 July 2016 and includes the following:</p>
<ul><li>eligibility and entitlement</li>
<li>FTB payments cease after leaving Australia permanently</li>
<li>FTB rate during temporary absences from Australia</li>
<li>individual and FTB child both overseas</li>
<li>absent overseas child - FTB child</li>
<li>absent overseas child - regular care child</li>
<li>absent overseas individual</li>
<li>child absence - effect of temporary absence on FTB rate</li>
<li>individual absence - effect of temporary absence on FTB rate</li>
<li>effect of prior absence overseas on FTB entitlement</li>
<li><a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ra" title="Rent assistance">RA</a> when an individual leaves Australia</li>
<li>effect of certain temporary visa categories on temporary absences</li>
<li>extensions in certain circumstances, and</li>
<li>international social security agreements.</li>
</ul><p>This topic discusses the rate of FTB payable during a temporary absence. The effect of a temporary absence on FTB eligibility is discussed in Temporary Absence from Australia before 1 July 2016 (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/2/1/2/30">2.1.2.30</a>).</p>
<h2>Eligibility &amp; entitlement</h2>
<p>The specific distinction between 'eligibility' (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/e/17">1.1.E.17</a>) and 'entitlement' (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/e/30">1.1.E.30</a>) in relation to absence from Australia is that:</p>
<ul><li>eligibility refers to the 56 week overseas absence period (after which time a person is no longer eligible for FTB), and</li>
<li>entitlement refers to the rates payable during a temporary absence.</li>
</ul><p>There are other events that may impact FTB eligibility and entitlement while an FTB individual is overseas but the examples in this topic only refer to impacts relating to absence from Australia.</p>
<h2>FTB payments cease after leaving Australia permanently</h2>
<p>FTB payments cease if an individual or child leaves Australia permanently, as they are no longer considered Australian residents (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/a/130">1.1.A.130</a>) for FTB purposes.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> FA Guide <a href="../family-assistance-guide/2/1/2/10">2.1.2.10</a> Residence requirements</p>
</div>
<h2>FTB rate during temporary absences from Australia</h2>
<p>The rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B may be affected when the FTB child and/or the individual leave/s Australia temporarily.</p>
<p><a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#es" title="Energy supplement">ES</a> Part A and Part B are generally treated under the same provisions as FTB except during absences from Australia. ES Part A and Part B can only be paid for the first 6 weeks of an overseas absence.</p>
<p>An individual may be able to continue to be paid an above base rate amount of FTB Part A (except ES) and FTB Part B if they are granted an extension to the 6 week return rule for rates, before the end of that 6 week period.</p>
<h2>Individual &amp; FTB child both overseas</h2>
<p>Where the individual and the FTB child are both overseas, the 6 week restrictions on entitlement in respect of the individual and FTB child as described in the tables below need to be considered together. Where the individual and FTB child have different departure dates, the 6 week period for the individual in respect of all their FTB children and the 6 week period in respect of the FTB child expire at different times. This means that where the individual is absent overseas before either the FTB child departs overseas or is born overseas, the restriction on the individual's entitlement should have an effect on the entitlement in respect of the FTB child.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Carmel receives FTB for John and Paul. She leaves Australia with John to visit relatives in Ireland. Paul joins his family 3 weeks later. The higher rate of FTB Part A for both children and FTB Part B cease at the end of 6 weeks commencing from Carmel's departure date even though Paul has been absent from Australia for only 3 weeks.</p>
</div>
<h2>Absent overseas child - FTB child</h2>
<p>An FTB child is an 'absent overseas FTB child' if the following applies:</p>
<ul><li>an FTB child leaves Australia, or</li>
<li>a child born outside Australia is an FTB child at birth, and</li>
<li>the child continues to be absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks, and</li>
<li>at the end of the 6 week period beginning on the first day of the child's absence, the child is an FTB child.</li>
</ul><p>The child is an absent overseas FTB child for any period that occurs:</p>
<ul><li>during the absence from Australia, and</li>
<li>beginning on the first day after the end of the 6 weeks of the child's absence, and</li>
<li>during the period in which the child continues to be an FTB child.</li>
</ul><p>If an absent overseas FTB child returns to Australia but leaves again after less than 6 weeks they are still considered to be an absent overseas FTB child.</p>
<h2>Absent overseas child - regular care child</h2>
<p>A child is an 'absent overseas regular care child' if any of the following applies:</p>
<ul><li>a regular care child leaves Australia, or</li>
<li>a child born outside Australia is a regular care child at birth, and</li>
<li>the child continues to be absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks, and</li>
<li>at the end of the 6 week period beginning on the first day of the child's absence, the child is a regular care child.</li>
</ul><p>The child is an absent overseas regular care child for any period that occurs:</p>
<ul><li>during the absence from Australia, and</li>
<li>beginning on the first day after the end of the 6 weeks of the child's absence, and</li>
<li>during the period in which the child continues to be a regular care child.</li>
</ul><p>If an absent overseas regular care child returns to Australia but leaves again after less than 6 weeks, they are still considered to be an absent overseas regular care child.</p>
<h2>Absent overseas individual</h2>
<p>An individual is an 'absent overseas recipient':</p>
<ul><li>during any absence from Australia, and</li>
<li>after the end of the period of 6 weeks beginning on the first day of that absence.</li>
</ul><p>If an absent overseas individual returns to Australia but leaves again after less than 6 weeks, they are still considered to be absent overseas.</p>

<h2>Child absence - effect of temporary absence on FTB rate</h2>
<p>The following table explains the rate of FTB payment to be applied for an FTB child where the FTB child is temporarily absent from Australia with a departure date prior to 1 July 2016. This table does not include ES as it is only payable for the first 6 weeks of a temporary absence from Australia.</p>

</ul></td>

<ul><li>for the first 6 weeks of the absence FTB Part A in respect of the child is payable at greater than the base FTB child rate and FTB Part B is paid in respect of the child</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The absence commences on the day of the child's departure or the day of their birth if born outside Australia.</p>
<ul><li>after 6 weeks absence, FTB Part A is only payable at the base rate in respect of the child and FTB Part B is not payable in respect of the child.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> FTB Part A is no longer payable after 56 weeks of absence because the child ceases to be an FTB child. Payment may cease earlier if there is evidence the child has left Australia permanently.</p>

<h2>Extensions in certain circumstances</h2>
<p>The 6 week period for payment of FTB Part A at more than the base rate, FTB Part B and RA may be extended in certain circumstances where the person is prevented from returning to Australia immediately but would otherwise remain eligible.</p>
<p>FTB Part A can also be extended beyond 56 weeks at the base rate for up to 3 years. This applies both to absences of the FTB child and the individual. However, for ES purposes, an absent overseas individual and an FTB child who is approved for an extended period would be precluded from entitlement to ES Part A and ES Part B.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which the Secretary may approve an extension include:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Specified events</th>
<td>
<ul><li>A serious accident involving the person or a family member of the person.</li>
<li>A serious illness of the person or a family member of the person.</li>
<li>The hospitalisation of the person or a family member of the person.</li>
<li>The death of a family member of the person.</li>
<li>The person's involvement in custody proceedings in the country in which the person is located.</li>
<li>A legal requirement for the person to remain outside Australia in connection with criminal proceedings (other than criminal proceedings in respect of a crime alleged to have been committed by the person).</li>
<li>Robbery or serious crime committed against the person or a family member of the person.</li>
<li>A natural disaster in the country in which the person is located.</li>
<li>Political or social unrest in the country in which the person is located.</li>
<li>Industrial action in the country in which the person is located.</li>
<li>A war in the country in which the person is located.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><th>Medical Treatment Overseas Program</th>
<td>
<p>The Secretary may extend the 56 week period to a period of no more than 3 years, if financial assistance is payable under the Medical Treatment Overseas Program for an individual or FTB child.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><th>Deployments</th>
<td>
<p>The Secretary may also extend the 56 week portability period to a period of no more than 3 years if the individual is:</p>
<ul><li>deployed outside Australia as a member of the Defence Force, under conditions specified in a determination made under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1903A00020"><cite>Defence Act 1903</cite></a> that relates to such deployment, or</li>
<li>deployed outside Australia, for the purpose of capacity-building or peacekeeping functions, as
<ul><li>a member or a special member of the Australian Federal Police, or</li>
<li>a protective service officer within the meaning of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02068"><cite>Australian Federal Police Act 1979</cite></a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Where an eligible person is to be deployed; they should contact Centrelink prior to departure and request a portability extension due to their overseas deployment. They may need to provide their deployment letter to confirm they are eligible for this extension. The extension for the deployed member is for the length of their deployment, up to a period of 3 years.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If the 6 week period is extended by the Secretary the individual and/or FTB child are not considered to be an absent overseas FTB recipient and/or absent overseas FTB child and/or absent overseas regular care child during a temporary absence until the end of that extension. This allows the individual or FTB child to attract the above base rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B for a temporary absence of more than 6 weeks, until the end date of the extension.</p>
<p>If the individual and/or child returns to Australia during their extension period and then leave Australia again less than 6 weeks after returning to Australia, the return provisions do not apply in determining their rate of FTB. A new 6 week absent overseas count restarts from their second departure date.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Peter and his FTB child Alex go overseas for a 4 week holiday. Alex becomes ill while overseas and in week 4 of their holiday is admitted into hospital for what looks likely to be 6 weeks. Peter advises Centrelink that they must remain overseas and applies for an extension to their 6 week period. This is granted by the Secretary for another 4 weeks. Alex is released from hospital and Alex and Peter return to Australia during their extension period. Peter and Alex then return overseas 5 weeks later as Peter's mother is ill. As they returned to Australia within the extended period, they should not be considered to have been absent overseas. This means they will receive more than the base rate of FTB for the first 6 weeks of their second departure. Peter will be entitled to base rate FTB Part A until the 56 week period expires. After the expiry of the 56 week period, which began on the date of his initial departure, Peter is not eligible for any FTB because he no longer satisfies the residency requirements.</p>
</div>
<p>Where the Secretary extends FTB Part A after the initial 6 week period, and the individual/child return to Australia, the return provisions do apply.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Romy and her FTB child Ben go overseas on a work placement. The rate of FTB Part B cancels after week 6 and FTB Part A drops to base rate. While overseas, a natural disaster occurs in week 55 and they are unable to leave.</p>
<p>Romy advises Centrelink that they must remain overseas and applies for an extension to their 56 week period. This is granted by the Secretary for another 4 weeks. Romy and Ben return to Australia during their extension period. Romy decides to return overseas 5 weeks later to assist with the recovery effort. As their extension was granted following the 6 week period they were initially considered to have been absent overseas and as they were overseas past 56 weeks, their portability period has expired. This means that Romy will have her FTB cancelled from her second departure.</p>

<h2>International social security agreements</h2>
<p>FTB is not included under international social security agreements. Instead, from 1 July 2000, 'additional child amount' is in the portability (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/p/90">1.1.P.90</a>) rate calculator of the SSAct.</p>
<p>The additional child amount is a fixed amount based on the family allowance and guardian allowance rates applicable at 30 June 2000. The payment is indexed in January each year according to the family allowance indexation rules. These indexation rules continue to apply after 1 July 2000 and only apply to this payment.</p>

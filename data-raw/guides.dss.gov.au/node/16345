<h1 >4.3.2.35 Income Exempt from Assessment - s 8(11) Exempt Lump Sums</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This topic provides information about lump sums exempted from the income test under SSAct section 8(11), and lists lump sums that have been specifically exempted:</p>
<ul><li>what are section 8(11) exemptions,</li>
<li>date of effect determination,</li>
<li>section 8(11) delegation,</li>
<li>list of lump sums that have been specifically exempted under section 8(11), and</li>
<li>detailed list of lump sums exempted to assist victims of Bali bombings of 12 October 2002.</li>
</ul><h2>What are section 8(11) exemptions?</h2>
<p>Some lump sums are NOT treated as income for social security purposes.</p>
<p>Section 8(11) determinations allows the Secretary of <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#dss" title="Department of Social Services">DSS</a> to exempt certain lump sums that are not periodic amounts, leave payments or income from remunerative work.</p>
<p>Section 8 (11) was introduced, together with amendments to section 1073, on 28 March 1998 to make a fairer and more consistent income test treatment of lump sums by aligning the allowance and pensions income test treatments.</p>
<p>Section 8(11) applies to specific lump sums where a delegate has signed the appropriate instrument.</p>
<p>The characteristics of an exempt lump sum payment are that it is unlikely to be repeated, cannot reasonably be expected to be received or necessarily anticipated, and does not represent receipt of monies for services rendered.</p>
<p>More information about income exempt from assessment can be found in <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/3/2/30">4.3.2.30</a> Income Exempt from Assessment - Legislated, and <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/3/2/31">4.3.2.31</a> Income Exempt from Assessment - Specifically Approved.</p>
<h2>Date of effect of determinations</h2>
<p>The discretion in section 8(11) to determine certain amounts as 'exempt lump sums' is effectively discharged where a delegate has made a determination that is lodged with the Federal Registrar of Legislative Instruments (FRLI). A determination, once made, would be subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. The interaction between the SSAct section 8(11) provisions and the date of effect rules in the SS(Admin)Act, mean that a rate increase decision or a resumption of payment decision resulting from the impact of section 8(11) determinations on a person's qualification or rate can only be backdated in some cases, for up to 13 weeks, from the date the section 8(11) determination causes the relevant rate increase decision or resumption decision.</p>

<h2>Section 8(11) delegation</h2>
<p>Under current Administrative Arrangements Orders (AAOs), DSS is responsible for administering payments under the social security law. Determinations are signed by the Secretary or the relevant delegate in DSS. Delegation to sign determinations is held by the Branch Manager of the Rates and Means Testing Policy Branch in DSS.</p>
<p>Exemption of a specific lump sum (e.g. a payment such as those specifically named in the list below) for income test purposes is obtained through Means Test Policy Section in DSS.</p>

<p>Changes were made to the <cite>Legislation Act 2003</cite> in 2012 to allow for the repeal of determinations that are spent or no longer required. Repeal of a determination does not undo its previous effect, nor does it limit rights, liabilities or formal proceedings in relation to the previous determination.</p>
<p>Some determinations made under section 8(11) have been repealed because the schemes for making the lump sum payments have closed or the lump sum payments have been finalised.</p>

<p>This determination exempts certain payments from the income test that are compensatory in nature, but which do not fall within the definition of compensation in the SSAct. These payments include, but are not limited to, those for:</p>
<ul><li>a criminal injury,</li>
<li>the death of a close relative,</li>
<li>discrimination, harassment, breach of human rights or breach of privacy,</li>
<li>non-economic loss under the <cite>Fair Work Act 2009</cite>, other than compensation for being unfairly dismissed,</li>
<li>loss as a result of negligent provision of professional services,</li>
<li>a personal injury, disease, or condition,</li>
<li>death benefits,</li>
<li>insurance in respect of specified medical trauma or event, and</li>
<li>death and permanent impairment under the <cite>Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 </cite>or the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#mrca" title="Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004">MRCA</a>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> This list is not a complete guide for decision makers. It is important to refer to the legislative instrument (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2017L00644">F2017L00644</a>) for more detailed information on exempt payments.</p>
<p>Where all or part of a payment is specifically for economic loss, this determination does not apply to the component for economic loss.</p>
<p>Where a compensatory type lump sum covered by this determination includes both economic loss and non-economic loss components, and the breakdown of these components is not known, 50% of the gross amount of the lump sum payment is exempt.</p>
<p>Where a lump sum is received instead of periodic payments for a set period (i.e. the lump sum is calculated at a set weekly, fortnightly or monthly rate over a specific period), they are not exempted as income under section 8(11).</p>
<p>This determination does not change the assessment of compensation payments under SSAct Part 3.14.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note:</strong> The initial exemption of a lump sum amount from the income test does NOT alter the fact that any on-going income generated by the lump sum is counted under the income test, and any assessable asset produced from the lump sum is counted under the social security assets test. Once the lump sum amount is invested or used to purchase goods or services, the usual income and assets rules will apply. For example, if the lump sum amount is used to buy a car, the car would be counted as an asset under the assets test. If the lump sum amount is spent on a holiday or on bills there would generally be no ongoing income or asset to be assessed. If the lump sum amount is placed in a financial investment (such as a bank account) the funds have then become a financial asset that would be assessable as an asset and subject to the income test deeming rules (refer to SSAct section 9(1) for all the types of financial assets).</p>

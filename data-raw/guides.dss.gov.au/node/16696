<h1 >3.7.2.20 Substantial Change in Circumstances for SpB</h1>
<h2>Substantial change in circumstances</h2>
<p>Some newly arrived persons may be paid <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#spb" title="Special benefit">SpB</a> during the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#narwp" title="Newly arrived resident's waiting period">NARWP</a>, if they have experienced a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../guide-social-security-law/4/2/6">4.2.6</a> SpB Income Test &amp; Limits</p>
</div>
<h2>Factors to consider for newly arrived persons</h2>
<p>To be paid SpB, the delegate must be satisfied that the person:</p>
<ul><li>has suffered a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control that occurred after their arrival in Australia and after the NARWP would have commenced, AND</li>
<li>is in financial hardship and satisfies the available funds test, AND</li>
<li>has attempted to obtain a sufficient livelihood from all possible alternative sources. For example, the person has attempted to obtain support from their sponsor (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/s/290">1.1.S.290</a>), or has attempted to obtain employment, AND</li>
<li>has depleted their available funds or support options because of the change in circumstances.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The person is not required to seek support from charity organisations.</p>
<p>The newly arrived person may be required to undertake mutual obligation activities if SpB is granted.</p>
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../guide-social-security-law/9/2">9.2</a> Visa Subclasses &amp; Payment Eligibility for Visas Issued After 1/9/94, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/8/1/4/60">8.1.4.60</a> Special Payments - Documentation Required, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/8/1/7/20">8.1.7.20</a> Social Worker Involvement - Specific Payments, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/3/7/1/70">3.7.1.70</a> Long Term Available Funds Test for SpB, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/3/7/5/20">3.7.5.20</a> Who do the SpB Mutual Obligation Requirements Apply to?</p>
<h2>Available funds</h2>
<p>A newly arrived person's available funds should NOT be taken to be depleted purely because they:</p>
<ul><li>cannot obtain or maintain employment, unless there is an exceptional delay (see 'Recognition of overseas qualifications' below) in recognition of qualifications in Australia (<a href="http://guides.dss.gov.au/guide-social-security-law/1/1/a/320">1.1.A.320</a>), or</li>
<li>have purchased a principal residence or investment property, or</li>
<li>cannot establish a business, or</li>
<li>are limited by the amount of funds they can bring with them when leaving their emigrating country.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> It is reasonable to expect that a person would be aware of the regulations imposed by their emigrating country and make appropriate arrangements for their support in Australia, before migrating.</p>
</div>
<h2>Recognition of overseas qualifications</h2>
<p>Delays of up to 2 years are possible when overseas qualifications need to be recognised in Australia. If verification has been obtained by Australian Education International - <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#noosr" title="National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition">NOOSR</a> (AEI-NOOSR), this would NOT be regarded as an exceptional delay.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The delays are due to requirements for meeting English standards and trade proficiency, and depend on a person's English language ability and level of tertiary or trade qualification.</p>
</div>
<h2>Sponsored newly arrived residents</h2>
<p>A sponsored newly arrived resident (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/n/60">1.1.N.60</a>) is a permanent visa holder who was nominated for migration to Australia by a sponsor. Sponsored residents must have made every effort to get adequate support from their sponsor before being granted SpB. Once an <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#aos" title="Assurance of support">AoS</a> has been entered into, SpB is only payable in cases where there has been an UNFORESEEN and substantial change in circumstances that occurred after the NARWP would have commenced.</p>
<h2>Non-sponsored newly arrived residents</h2>
<p>A non-sponsored newly arrived resident is a permanent visa holder who was not nominated for migration to Australia by a sponsor.</p>
<h2>Changed circumstances that WOULD be considered substantial for the purposes of SpB</h2>
<p>Many changes in circumstances apply equally to sponsored and non-sponsored permanent residents and temporary visa holders (subclass 309 and 820 partner visa holders).</p>
<p>The following table provides examples of circumstances that WOULD be considered a substantial change in circumstances for the purposes of waiving the NARWP, noting that the substantial change in circumstances must occur after the commencement of the NARWP and the person must have no other means of support.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Change in circumstance</th>
<th scope="col">And…</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A sponsor, partner or SpB claimant develops a prolonged illness or acquires an injury,</td>
<td>is unable to work and/or there are significant medical costs.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sponsor or partner loses job through no fault of their own,</td>
<td>is no longer able to support the SpB claimant.</td>
</tr><tr><td>After commencing work, the SpB claimant loses their job through no fault of their own,</td>
<td>the job commenced or was arranged prior to the commencement of the person's NARWP.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sponsor or partner dies,</td>
<td>no provision of support was provided for the SpB claimant.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Partner and SpB claimant separate,</td>
<td>the SpB claimant was the victim of domestic/family violence.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Child is born or family becomes responsible for a dependent child,</td>
<td>the child has a severe medical condition or a severe disability that incurs significant additional costs to the SpB claimant and/or partner.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Dependent child develops a severe medical condition, disability or sustains a serious injury,</td>
<td>the SpB claimant is unable to work and/or there are significant medical costs being incurred by the SpB claimant and/or the partner.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sponsor or partner becomes a long term prisoner, or is confined long term to a hospital, psychiatric institution or nursing home,</td>
<td>is no longer able to support the SpB claimant.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sponsor or partner has been notified as a missing person or has abandoned the SpB claimant,</td>
<td>is no longer supporting the SpB claimant.</td>
</tr><tr><td>SpB claimant is the victim of substantiated domestic violence, (the perpetrator may not be a partner or sponsor),</td>
<td>the impact of the domestic violence results in the SpB claimant losing their means of support, for example, unable to continue working or required to relocate.</td>
</tr><tr><td>SpB claimant who has been granted permanent residence resulting in their Australian citizen child no longer being eligible for SpB,</td>
<td>the SpB claimant is not working or their earnings are below the SpB income cut-out point.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>Where domestic and/or family violence is involved, the claimant must be referred to a social worker. A social worker will assess and document the claimant's situation. The information provided by a social worker should contribute to a decision about qualification for SpB, but the delegate, NOT the social worker, makes the final decision about qualification.</p>
<h2>Changed circumstances that are NOT substantial for the purposes of SpB</h2>
<p>The following situations would NOT be considered a substantial change in circumstances for the purpose of waiving the NARWP - where no other extenuating circumstances are involved:</p>
<ul><li>Claimant and partner are separated but living under one roof.</li>
<li>Partner and the visa holder separate due to breakdown of the relationship and there is no domestic violence involved.</li>
<li>Partner misrepresents their circumstances (financial, physical, material) and the partnered provisional visa holder chooses to leave because of this.</li>
<li>Partner leaves work to study or train, engages in an unprofitable business, resorts to excessive gambling or makes another lifestyle choice that impacts on the couple financially.</li>
<li>A claim is lodged after 1 January 2012 and the person states they are unaware of the legislative change that removed family member as an exemption from the NARWP for partnered provisional visa holders.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Upon arrival in Australia the person finds that the partner has embellished claims of circumstances, living standards and financial support and the claimant decides to leave. The person lodges a claim for SpB. As the onus is on the person to fully investigate the situation into which they are migrating, this is not considered to be a substantial change in circumstances beyond the person's control and SpB MAY NOT be paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The SpB claimant and the partner decide to have a child during the NARWP period. The birth of a child (including multiple births) is not considered to be a substantial change in circumstances as it is a lifestyle choice over which the couple have control and SpB MAY NOT be paid.</p>
</div>
<p>While there is an expectation that a claimant and their partner are responsible for the decisions affecting their individual situations, mitigating circumstances may exist that require additional deliberation when assessing a person's claim for SpB. The delegate must consider all available information regarding the claimant's individual circumstances before deciding if there is a substantial change in circumstances that was beyond the person's control.</p>
<h2>Timing of the substantial change in circumstances</h2>
<p>A person must have suffered a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control after arrival in Australia and after their NARWP would otherwise have commenced. The following table provides the timing of a substantial change in circumstances for permanent and temporary holders, noting that subclass 309 and 820 visa holders (partner provisional visa holders) are the only temporary visa holders required to serve the SpB NARWP.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Visa type</th>
<th scope="col">When the substantial change in circumstances must occur</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Person holds a permanent visa granted in Australia.</td>
<td>After the person became the holder of the visa.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Person holds a permanent visa granted outside of Australia.</td>
<td>After the person first entered Australia on the visa.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Person holds a subclass 820 (Partner) visa (a person applies for this visa in Australia).</td>
<td>After the person applied for the visa.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Person holds a subclass 309 (Partner (Provisional)) visa (a person applies for this visa outside of Australia).</td>
<td>After the person first entered Australia after having applied for the visa.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The NARWP is designed to ensure that people seeking to settle permanently in Australia are self-reliant for a period when they first arrive. The change in circumstances exemption is intended to provide a safety net for migrants whose circumstances change while they are serving the NARWP and who are no longer able to support themselves as planned for rest of that period. People who have a change in circumstances before commencement of the NARWP are expected to factor their new circumstances into their plans for how they will support themselves during this period.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A person working in Australia on a temporary visa decides to settle in Australia permanently and applies for a permanent skilled visa. Before the visa is granted, the employer's business closes and the person is no longer employed. This is not a substantial change of circumstances beyond the person's control because it occurred before the person was granted a permanent resident visa and SpB MAY NOT be paid.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> After arriving in Australia on a permanent visa, a person suffers a serious long-term illness, which prevents them from working. The illness is deemed severe enough to be considered a substantial change in circumstances and SpB MAY be paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A person is granted a permanent visa outside of Australia and has been offered employment in Australia to commence upon arrival. Before arriving in Australia, the offer of employment is withdrawn. This is not a substantial change of circumstances beyond the person's control as the substantial change in circumstances occurred before the person entered Australia and SpB MAY NOT be paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> A person in Australia on a tourist visa becomes the partner of an Australian resident and applies for a subclass 820 visa (partner provisional visa) and a permanent resident visa on 1 January 2017. The person is granted the subclass 820 visa on 1 June 2017 for a period of 2 years before being granted a permanent visa. On 1 March 2018, the person's partner ceases work due to ill health and can no longer support the person. As the substantial change in circumstances occurred after the person applied for the subclass 820 visa on 1 January 2017, SpB MAY be paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5:</strong> A person is granted a subclass 309 visa outside of Australia to migrate to Australia and marry their Australian citizen partner. Prior to the person entering Australia their partner becomes unemployed. Shortly after arrival in Australia, the person claims SpB due to financial hardship. This is not a substantial change in circumstances beyond the person's control as it occurred before the person entered Australia after applying for the subclass 309 visa and SpB MAY NOT be paid.</p>

<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 739A(7) Newly arrived resident's waiting period</p>

<h2>Timing of substantial change in circumstances due to domestic &amp;/or family violence</h2>
<p>An episode of domestic and/or family violence may not be isolated to one particular event. Victims often suffer an episode of domestic and/or family violence over a period of time that may include incidences of abuse, leaving the perpetrator, and in many cases, a period of trauma. Domestic and/or family violence can have significant impacts on a person's ability to support themselves.</p>
<p>The timing of a substantial change in circumstances for a SpB claimant who is the victim of family and/or domestic violence is not necessarily the day on which the abuse occurred or the day that the victim left the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Where these events occurred before the commencement of the person's NARWP, consideration must be given as to whether the person is still being impacted by the domestic and/or family violence. For example, if a SpB claimant is unable to seek work or take up employment because of trauma or intimidation the delegate, in consultation with the social worker, may regard the person to be currently experiencing the effects of family and/or domestic violence. In this situation, the person would be regarded as having suffered domestic and/or family violence both before and after the commencement of the NARWP and SpB may be paid. In addition, in determining whether the person has depleted their available funds or support options due to the substantial change in circumstances, the delegate should compare the person's current circumstances with the person's circumstances immediately before they experienced this episode of family and/or domestic violence.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person arrives in Australia on a temporary skilled visa and applies for a permanent skilled visa. Prior to grant of the permanent visa, the person experiences family and/or domestic violence and as a result is forced to leave their employment. The person is subsequently granted a permanent visa and applies for SpB. As the person is suffering ongoing trauma that is preventing them from being able to work, the person is regarded as having suffered family and/or domestic violence since the start of the NARWP which constitutes a substantial change in circumstances and SpB MAY be paid.</p>
</div>
<h2>Substantial change in circumstances outside of Australia</h2>
<p>A substantial change in circumstances beyond a person's control may occur outside of Australia if the substantial change in circumstances occurs after the commencement of the NARWP. See Timing of the substantial change in circumstances in this topic.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> After arrival in Australia on a permanent visa a person who is employed full-time takes a holiday overseas where they are involved in a serious car accident. After returning to Australia, the person is unable to resume their employment due to their injuries and has no other means of support. As the substantial change in circumstances occurred after the person first arrived in Australia on a permanent visa, SpB MAY be paid.</p>
</div>
<h2>Confirmation of changed circumstances</h2>
<p>All newly arrived persons claiming to be in hardship due to a substantial change in circumstances must substantiate their claim with documentation where available. If documentation is not available, the delegate may need to assist the SpB claimant provide evidence of a substantial change in circumstances, which may include a referral to social worker if appropriate.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A claim that a pre-arranged job fell through would have to be substantiated by evidence both that a job offer existed and that at the time it was withdrawn, the person was in Australia.</p>
</div>
<h2>Changed circumstances no longer apply</h2>
<p>Where a person has been granted SpB during the NARWP due to a substantial change in circumstances and those circumstances subsequently change prior to completion of the NARWP, an exemption from the NARWP may no longer be warranted. A review of the person's circumstances should be undertaken. Advice may be sought from a social worker, or a referral made, if necessary.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A SpB recipient and partner reconcile after separation and are residing together as a family unit. The original decision to grant SpB during the NARWP was based on a substantial change in circumstances due to domestic violence and separation from the partner. As the SpB recipient and partner have reconciled the substantial change in circumstances no longer exists and SpB ceases to be payable for the remainder of the NARWP.</p>

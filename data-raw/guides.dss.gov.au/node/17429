<h1 >2.2.1.10 General Procedures for Confirming &amp; Verifying Identity</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This topic covers:</p>
<ul><li>principles of identity,</li>
<li>identity confirmation requirements for children,</li>
<li>identity confirmation requirements for claimants/recipients,</li>
<li>identity confirmation requirements for partners,</li>
<li>sighting and recording identity documents by Centrelink staff and agents,</li>
<li>original identity documents not sighted by Centrelink staff,</li>
<li>identity confirmation for victims of major or widespread disasters (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/m/20">1.1.M.20</a>, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/p/60">1.1.P.60</a>),</li>
<li>identity confirmation for reclaims or abridged claims,</li>
<li>identity confirmation for transfers, and</li>
<li>identity confirmation when claiming an additional payment.</li>
</ul><h2>Principles of identity</h2>
<p>The requirement for identity confirmation and verification is based on SS(Admin)Act section 8, which states that abuses of the social security system are to be minimised. The Identity Confirmation model was introduced by Centrelink in May 2015 and is based on the minimum identity proofing requirements as outlined in the National Identity Proofing Guidelines (NIPG). The model requires a person to prove their identity when making a new claim and/or confirming their identity for the first time. Verification of the presented documents occurs by verifying the validity of the document with the issuing authority using the Document Verification Service (DVS) or by other means where necessary. The Commonwealth NIPG were used to develop the process for identity proofing and identity maintenance.</p>
<p>The Identity Confirmation model is based on 4 objectives when verifying a person's identity.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Objective</th>
<th scope="col">Details</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Confirm the uniqueness of the identity</td>
<td>This objective aims to establish that the identity is unique and includes checks that the person is the sole claimant of the identity.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Confirm that the claimed identity is legitimate</td>
<td>
<p>Under this objective, evidence of the commencement of the identity in Australia should be provided, either through:</p>
<ul><li>birth in Australia, or</li>
<li>for persons born overseas, commencement of the identity in Australia in the form of an immigration record or document.</li>
</ul><p>Satisfying this objective also includes checks on the identity against records of death.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>Confirm the operation of the identity over time</td>
<td>
<p>This objective aims to establish the use of an identity in interaction with Government and the community over time.</p>
<ul><li>The locational aspect of identity supports the other principles by establishing that the person was contactable at a particular address, allowing further verification to take place.</li>
<li>The historical aspect of identity provides a history of the use of the identity and establishes a number of points where the identity can be validated through other data sources.</li>
</ul><p>To confirm the operation of the identity, a person needs to present one primary and one secondary identity document from the approved list (Centrelink form SS231 'Confirming your identity').</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>Confirm the linkage between the identity and the person claiming the identity</td>
<td>
<p>This objective seeks to link the identity with the person and to ensure that the person using the identity has a legitimate right to do so. Confirmation of the linkage can be done in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>Manual-visual comparison of a person's face against a photograph on a primary, verifiable piece of evidence.</li>
<li>Knowledge based authentication of randomised questions derived from multiple authoritative sources.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>The confirmation of identity also includes a check that the identity is not used fraudulently.</p>

<h2>Identity confirmation requirements for children</h2>
<p>For identity confirmation for children refer to the FA Guide.</p>
<p>For identity confirmation for foster children refer to the SS Guide.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../guide-social-security-law/3/9/1/45">3.9.1.45</a> Foster Child HCC</p>
<p>FA Guide <a href="../family-assistance-guide/2/1/1/15">2.1.1.15</a> Verification of Child's Name &amp; Date of Birth</p>
</div>
<h2>Identity confirmation requirements for claimants</h2>
<p>To receive a social security pension, benefit or allowance, low income <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#hcc" title="Health care card">HCC</a> or <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#cshc" title="Commonwealth seniors health card">CSHC</a>, a claimant must provide original identity documents considered by Centrelink sufficient to confirm their identity. For some documents verifiable through the DVS, a certified copy of a document may be accepted. Photographic documents presented as a linkage between the person and the identity should always be original.</p>
<p>To confirm their identity, claimants need to provide 1 document from each of the following 3 categories, 1 of which should be a photographic identity document used to link the person to the claimed identity:</p>
<ul><li>1 Commencement of Identity document,</li>
<li>1 Primary Use in Community document, and</li>
<li>1 Secondary Use in Community document.</li>
</ul><p>Documents presented need to be verifiable with an authoritative source, by either verifying through the DVS or contacting the issuer if needed. A list of acceptable documents is available from Centrelink (accessible on the form SS231 'Confirming your identity'). If the documents provided are current and valid, but in different names, a change of name document also needs to be provided and recorded on the system. For claimants in special circumstances where this might not be possible, alternative proof of change of name may be accepted. For identity to be confirmed, the main aspects of identity such as name, middle name, surname and date of birth must be taken from an authoritative source and verified.</p>
<p>Once a person's identity is confirmed, they may only need to authenticate their identity by establishing ownership of the identity when making future claims for payments or programmes, or when notifying a change to their circumstances. This will be done by presenting a photographic identity document that links them to the identity or by answering a series of knowledge based verification questions.</p>
<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Most recipients will still need to confirm their identity at major entitlement reviews and provide identity documents. The exception to this will be recipients whose identity has been confirmed under the identity confirmation guidelines using the DVS. These recipients will still need to present a photographic identity document as linkage between themselves and their record at review.</p>
<h2>Identity confirmation requirements for partners</h2>
<p>To receive a social security pension, benefit or allowance, claimants must also provide the full name, address, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#dob" title="Date of birth">DOB</a>, <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#tfn" title="Tax file number">TFN</a> and income and asset details of their non-claimant partner.</p>
<p>Identity confirmation is not required for a non-claimant partner EXCEPT where the claimant has claimed <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#ppp" title="Parenting payment (partnered)">PPP</a>, or the low income HCC or <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#pbbp" title="Pension bonus bereavement payment">PBBP</a>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> As the partner is entitled to receive benefits from the partner's claim, or in the case of PBBP the person receives payment based on their deceased partner's accrued bonus, their identity must be verified to the same level as the claimant for PPP and HCC.</p>
</div>
<p>For all other payments and benefits each person must claim in their own right. When this occurs their identity will be verified.</p>
<p>Partner details are not required for claimants of a foster child HCC.</p>
<h2>Sighting &amp; recording of identity documents by Centrelink staff &amp; agents</h2>
<p>When a person presents identity documents, staff or agents must check that they are unaltered original documents from Centrelink's approved list (accessible on the form SS231 'Proving your identity to Centrelink'), and that the information and signature on each document offered is consistent with the claim form and any other documents provided.</p>
<p>Documents should be sighted, recorded on to the system and returned to the person.</p>
<h2>Original identity documents not sighted by Centrelink staff</h2>
<p>Where the claimant/recipient is unable to attend a Centrelink <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#csc" title="Customer Service Centre">CSC</a> or Centrelink agent they may arrange for the copies of their identity documents to be certified by an Australian, state or local government official, or by a Justice of the Peace.</p>
<p>Certified copies of identity documents may be accepted if the claimant/recipient resides in rural or remote areas, lodges their documents by mail, or if the claimant/recipient has difficulty in attending the CSC due to a medical condition such as decreased mobility, hospitalisation or institutional care.</p>
<p>For these cases:</p>
<ul><li>the claimant/recipient must be contacted and advised that the documents need to be provided to Centrelink within a reasonable time period, normally 4 weeks, and</li>
<li>in accepting the documents, the customer service adviser should be satisfied that the documents provided are true copies.</li>
</ul><h2>Identity confirmation requirements for victims of major or widespread disasters</h2>
<p>Normal identity confirmation guidelines do NOT apply to victims of major or widespread disasters or of Part 2.23B major disasters. Where social welfare payments have been granted during an emergency with insufficient identity documents presented, identity verification and/or confirmation must be followed up after the emergency period and the identity of the recipient established.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Victims of major or widespread disasters or of Part 2.23B major disasters who are not already departmental recipients may find it difficult to satisfy the department's normal identity confirmation requirements.</p>
</div>
<h2>Identity confirmation requirements for reclaims or abridged claims</h2>
<p>Once a person's identity has been confirmed under the new identity management framework using the DVS, they will only need to authenticate their identity. This is because identity has been established previously through a full identity confirmation process when a claimant/recipient first presents a claim. Authentication will be done by presenting a photographic identity document that links them to the identity or by answering a series of knowledge based verification questions. If the claimant/recipient cannot authenticate, then the full identity confirmation process will commence. All relevant details must then be recorded by the customer service adviser on the POI screen.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> As part of changes to proof of identity processes under the new identity proofing guidelines, once a person's identity has been confirmed, they may only need to authenticate to claim other payments, programs or services. Claimants/recipients who do not have a confirmed identity with documents verified through the DVS or who had been granted an identity review period or exemption must meet the standard identity requirements. For claimants/recipients experiencing difficulty with identity confirmation, see <a href="../guide-social-security-law/2/2/1/40">2.2.1.40</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>If a claimant/recipient has previously satisfied identity proofing requirements under arrangements for people experiencing difficulty with verifying identity, but they do not have a confirmed identity, they will need to supply identity documents to be granted again.</p>
<h2>Identity confirmation requirements for transfers</h2>
<p>When a break in a recipient's payment is less than 14 days (transfers), and they have a confirmed identity under the new identity proofing guidelines, they will only need to authenticate their identity.</p>
<p>If the recipient's identity is not confirmed under the new identity proofing guidelines, they will need to confirm their identity. If a recipient transfers to another payment that requires additional verification, e.g. age requirements, normal verification procedures for these details will apply.</p>
<h2>Identity confirmation requirements when claiming an additional payment</h2>
<p>Arrangements are the same as for transfers.</p>

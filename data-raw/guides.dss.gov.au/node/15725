<h1 >8.6.7 Summary of Rules for Date of Effect - Determinations Involving Working Credit or Student Income Bank</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section deals with situations where a person's claim for a social security payment has already been granted and a change in the person's circumstances affects the continuation of the payment or the rate of payment to which the person is entitled.</p>
<p>The table below sets out the date of effect rules related to the conditions required to distinguish one rule from another, together with references to the authorising legislative provisions. The legislation is organised by the types of determination, which the Secretary makes in response to changes in a person's circumstances. To work out the category of determination, you need to decide:</p>
<ul><li>whether the determination is 'favourable' or 'adverse',</li>
<li>whether the determination is 'automatic' or 'manual', and</li>
<li>whether the person is a 'notification reporter' or a 'statement reporter'.</li>
</ul><p>This table applies to all working credit recipients under age pension age for all determinations involving employment income and all student income bank recipients for all determinations involving ordinary income.</p>
<p>The table uses a number of terms and abbreviations to assist in the presentation of the complex legislative provisions, which apply to working credit and student income bank date of effect provisions. When the following terms or abbreviations are used in the table below, they must be read as having the definitions which follow:</p>
<ul><li>Date of effect (DOE) - the first day on which the person's payment increases, decreases or ceases, as a result of a determination.</li>
<li>Working credit (WC).</li>
<li>Student income bank (SIB).</li>
<li>Event - abbreviation for 'event or change in circumstances' as used in the SS(Admin)Act.</li>
<li>Ordinary income (OI) - all income earned, derived or received or taken to be earned, derived or received by a person except maintenance income: SSAct section 8(1) other than an amount excluded under sections 8(4), 8(5) or 8(8).</li>
<li>Employment income (EI) - a subset of OI, defined in SSAct section 8(1A).</li>
<li>Notification period - the period within which a person subject to paragraph 68(2)(a) requirements must notify the department of an event: this is 14 days for all information other than information that a person becomes aware he or she has received or is about to receive a compensation payment, where it is 7 days: SS(Admin)Act section 72(3).</li>
<li>Social security payment (SSP) - a periodic social security pension or a social security benefit.</li>
<li>Instalment period (IP) - periodic social security payments are paid by instalments in arrears, and instalment periods must not exceed 14 days: SS(Admin)Act section 43(1).</li>
<li>Event instalment period (EIP) - the IP in which an event occurs.</li>
<li>Nil instalment period (NIP) - the IP in which a person's WC/SIB balance reduces to nil.</li>

<h1 >1.4.2 History of the application of the CSRC Act to WA ex-nuptial cases</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The WA Parliament has adopted the CSRC Act and all amendments made to this Act. This means that the CSRC Act and all amendments made to this Act apply to WA ex-nuptial cases. With the <cite>Child Support (Commonwealth Powers) Act 2019</cite> (WA) <span class="nobr">(CS(CP)Act)</span> receiving Royal Assent on 15 May 2019, the WA Parliament has also referred legislation power for matters in respect of the maintenance of ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth. Prior to 15 May 2019, the arrangement by which the WA Parliament adopted child support laws meant that, from time to time, the Registrar needed to treat WA ex-nuptial cases differently to other cases.</p>

</ul><h2 id="2019">WA adoption of CSRC Act amendments from 15 May 2019</h2>
<p>From Royal Assent on 15 May 2019, the CS(CP)Act adopted all Commonwealth child support laws not previously adopted, referred legislation power for matters in respect of the maintenance of ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth, and repealed the <cite>Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990</cite> (WA), as there is no further need for the WA Parliament to incrementally adopt Commonwealth amendments to child support legislation. Legislative powers over unmarried persons and their children in family law proceedings were not referred.</p>
<p>From 15 May 2019 the CS(CP)Act adopted the amended CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2018, including amendments made by the <cite>Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018</cite>, including the application provisions in that Act. These amendments:</p>
<ul><li>aligned the Registrar's ability to recover child support overpayments from payees with the methods for recovering child support debts from payers, and</li>
<li>ensure that child support overpayments resulting from amounts collected by the Registrar prior to backdated reductions to child support assessments, are recoverable.</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00017"><cite>Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Act 2018</cite></a> amended the CSRC Act commencing 1 May 2018. The amendment provided that deductions can be taken from a person's veteran payment where they owe a child support debt, which is consistent with other income support payments under the <cite>Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</cite> listed under section 72AC(1)(b) of the CSRC Act. As this amendment had occurred after the WA parliament adopted the CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2017, this provision applies to WA ex-nuptial children from 15 May 2019.</p>
<h2 id="2017">WA adoption of CSRC Act amendments from 1 July 2017</h2>
<p>The amendment of the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA) by the <cite>Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Amendment Act 2017</cite> (WA) commenced on 1 July 2017.

<li>the <cite>Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Act 2007</cite> (Cth).</li>
</ul><h2 id="commencement">Commencement of the CSRC Act</h2>

<h1 >1.4.2 Application of the CSRC Act to WA Ex-nuptial Cases</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CSRC Act as amended, applies to WA ex-nuptial cases to the extent that it has been adopted by the WA Parliament.</p>
<p>The WA Parliament has adopted the CSRC Act and certain amendments made to this Act. The arrangement by which the WA Parliament has adopted these laws means that, from time to time, the Registrar must treat WA ex-nuptial cases differently to other cases.</p>

</ul><h2>WA adoption of CSRC Act amendments from 4 December 2014</h2>
<p>The <cite>Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Amendment Act 2014</cite> (WA) commenced on 4 December 2014.

</ul><h2>WA adoption of CSRC Act amendments from 28 November 2015</h2>
<p>The amendment of the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA) by the <cite>Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Amendment Act 2015</cite> (WA) commenced on 28 November 2015. From that day, the amended Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA) adopted the amended CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, which included amendments to the CSRC Act made by the <cite>Treasury Legislation Amendment (Repeal Day) Act 2015</cite> and the <cite>Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015</cite>.</p>
<p>The amendment to the CSRC Act made by the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Repeal Day) Act 2015 applies to cases involving WA ex-nuptial children from 28 November 2015. The amendment, which applies to all other cases from 1 July 2015, is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The definition of a resident of Australia was amended due to amendments to the definition of Australia under taxation legislation. This amendment to the CSRC Act provides that the definition of a resident of Australia continues to exclude residents of the external territories for child support purposes.</li>
</ul><p>The Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015 merged the AAT, the SSAT, Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal. The amalgamated tribunal is called the AAT. The amendments to the CSRC Act made by the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015 apply to cases involving WA ex-nuptial children from 28 November 2015. The amendments, which apply to all other cases from 1 July 2015, include:</p>
<ul><li>child support decisions reviewed by the previous SSAT are now reviewed by the amalgamated tribunal, with these reviews being allocated to the Social Services and Child Support Division of the AAT,</li>
<li>new defined terms of 'AAT first review' and 'AAT second review' that correspond with the previous SSAT and AAT reviews of child support matters respectively,</li>
<li>amendments to preserve existing procedures for merits review of child support matters,</li>
<li>amendments to streamline pathways for judicial review, so that judicial review of AAT decisions in relation to child support would be conducted by the Federal Circuit Court and Federal Court under the AAT Act, which is a departure from the previous policy that allowed various courts to have jurisdiction to hear appeals from SSAT decisions under Division 3 of Part VIII of the CSRC Act, and</li>
<li>consequential amendments to replace references to the SSAT with references to the AAT.</li>
</ul><h2>CSRC Act amendments which do not apply to WA ex-nuptial cases</h2>
<p>On 31 July 2015, section 4AA of the <cite>Crimes Act 1914</cite> was amended by the <cite>Crimes Legislation Amendment (Penalty Unit) Act 2015</cite> to increase the penalty unit amount to $180. Due to amendments made by the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Amendment Act 2015 (WA), the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA) has adopted the amended CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2015. Therefore, the penalty unit amount remains at $170 for WA ex‑nuptial cases because this was the penalty unit that applied on 1 July 2015.</p>
<p>The <cite>Civil Law and Justice (Omnibus Amendments) Act 2015</cite> repealed section 96B of the CSRC Act and this commenced on 14 October 2015. The <cite>Australian Immunisation Register (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2015</cite> inserted the <cite>Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015</cite> into subsection 16AB(3) of the CSRC Act and this commenced on 1 January 2016. As these amendments occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the Commonwealth CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, these amendments will not apply to WA ex-nuptial children until the WA Parliament adopts the CSRC Act as it existed on 14 October 2015 and/or 1 January 2016 or a later date.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2016, the definition of 'resident of Australia' in the CSRC Act was amended by the <cite>Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015</cite>. This amendment provided that residents of Norfolk Island are residents of Australia for child support purposes, and enables residents of Norfolk Island to apply for child support. As this amendment occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, the definition of a 'resident of Australia' in section 4 of the CSRC Act that is to apply to WA ex-nuptial cases will continue to exclude Norfolk Island residents as residents of Australia for child support purposes.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2016, the definition of 'resident of Australia' in the CSRC Act was further amended by the <cite>Territories Legislation Amendment Act 2016</cite>. This amendment provided that residents of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are residents of Australia for child support purposes, and enables these residents to apply for child support. As this amendment occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, the definition of 'resident of Australia' in section 4 of the CSRC Act that is to apply to WA ex-nuptial cases will continue to exclude residents of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands for child support purposes.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2017, section 4AA of the Crimes Act was amended by the <cite>Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Act 2017</cite> to increase the penalty unit amount to $210, and for this amount to be automatically indexed in line with changes in the CPI on 1 July 2020 and each third 1 July following that day. As this amendment occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSRC Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, the penalty unit amount remains at $170 for WA ex‑nuptial cases.</p>

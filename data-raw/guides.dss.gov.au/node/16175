<h1 >4.9.2.60 Sections 9A (Lifetime) &amp; 9B (Life Expectancy) of the SSAct Applying Prior to 20/09/2004</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This topic contains the legislation that applied to ATE income streams purchased before 20 September 2004. It is contained here as historical reference. This topic covers:</p>
<ul><li>section 9A (lifetime income streams) of the SSAct applying prior to 20 September 2004, and</li>
<li>section 9B (life expectancy income streams) of the SSAct applying prior to 20 September 2004.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The term 'spouse' was removed from sections 9A and 9B of the SSAct and replaced with 'partner' as a result of the same-sex amendments. This was in line with the Government's commitment to remove potentially discriminatory terms from legislation and policy.</p>
<h2>Section 9A (lifetime income streams) of the SSAct applying prior to 20/09/2004</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C06856"><p><strong>Meaning of <em>asset-test exempt income</em> stream-lifetime income streams</strong></p>
<p><em>General requirements</em></p>
<p><strong>9A(1)</strong> An income stream provided to a person is an asset-test exempt income stream for the purposes of this Act if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(a) it is an income stream arising under a contract, or governing rules, that meet the requirements of <span class="nobr">subsection (2)</span> and the Secretary has not made a determination under <span class="nobr">subsection (4)</span> in respect of the income stream; and</li>
<li>(b) subject to subsections (1B) and (1C), the Secretary is satisfied that in relation to an income stream, provided by a class of provider specified by the Secretary for the purposes of this paragraph, there is in force a current actuarial certificate that states that in the actuary's opinion there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules; and</li>
<li>(c) the Secretary is satisfied that the requirements of subsection (2) are being given effect to from the day the income stream commences to be paid.</li>
</ul><p><em>Determination under subsection (5)</em></p>
<p><strong>9A(1A)</strong> An income stream provided to a person is an asset-test exempt income stream for the purposes of this Act if the Secretary has made a determination under <span class="nobr">subsection (5)</span> in respect of the income stream.</p>
<p><em>Guidelines relating to actuarial certificates</em></p>
<p><strong>9A(1B)</strong> The Secretary may determine, in writing, guidelines to be complied with when determining whether an actuarial certificate is in force and what constitutes a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules.</p>
<p><strong>9A(1C)</strong> Paragraph (1)(b) does not apply if, for a period beginning when an actuarial certificate referred to in that paragraph ceases to be in force and ending not more than 26 weeks later, such an actuarial certificate is not in force.</p>
<p><em>Requirements of contract/governing rules for provision of income stream</em></p>
<p><strong>9A(2)</strong> A contract, or the governing rules, for the provision of an income stream to a person meet the requirements of this subsection if the contract or governing rules specify:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(a) that payments under the income stream are to be made at least annually throughout the life of the person and, if there is a reversionary beneficiary:<br /><ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(i) throughout the reversionary beneficiary's life; or</li>
<li>(ii) if the reversionary beneficiary is a child of the person or of a former reversionary beneficiary under the income stream-at least until he or she turns 16; or</li>
<li>(iii) if the child referred to in subparagraph (ii) is a full-time student who has turned 16-at least until the end of his or her full-time studies or until he or she turns 25, whichever occurs sooner; and</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(b) the total amount of the payments that may be made under the income stream in the first year after the commencement day of the income stream (not taking commuted amounts into account); and</li>
<li>(c) that the total amount of the payments that may be made under the income stream in any other year (not taking commuted amounts into account) may not fall below the total amount of the payments made under the income stream in the immediately preceding year (the <strong><em>previous total</em></strong>), and may not exceed the previous total:<br /><ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(i) if subparagraph (ii) does not apply-by more than 5% of the previous total; or</li>
<li>(ii) if the index number for the second last quarter before the day on which the first of those payments is to be made (<strong><em>recent index number</em></strong>) exceeds the index number for the same quarter in the immediately preceding year (<strong><em>base index number</em></strong>) by more than 4% of the base index number-by more than such percentage of the previous total as is worked out under the formula:
<p>					<img alt="Subtract the Base index number from the Recent index number, divide this result by the Base index number, multiply by 100, add 1" src="../sites/default/files/images/2.png" style="height:45px; width:359px" /></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(d) if the income stream is purchased-that the first payment under the income stream relates to the period commencing on the day on which the income stream is purchased; and</li>
<li>(e) if the income stream is not purchased-that the first payment under the income stream relates to the period commencing on the day on which the income stream is acquired; and</li>
<li>(f) if the income stream is not a defined benefit income stream-that the amount paid as the purchase price for the income stream is wholly converted into income; and</li>
<li>(g) that the income stream has no residual capital value; and</li>
<li>(h) that the income stream cannot be commuted except:<br /><ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(i) if the income stream is a non-commutation funded income stream and the commutation is made within 6 months after the commencement day of the income stream; or</li>
<li>(ii) if the commutation is made to the benefit of a reversionary beneficiary or of the person's estate, on the death of the person within 10 years after the commencement day of the income stream; or</li>
<li>(iii) if the payment resulting from the commutation is transferred directly to the purchase of another income stream arising under a contract, or governing rules, that meet the requirements of this subsection or <span class="nobr">subsection 9B(2)</span>; or</li>
<li>(iv) to the extent necessary to cover any superannuation contributions surcharge that the person is liable to pay in his or her capacity as purchaser of the income stream; or</li>
<li>(iva) to the extent necessary to give effect to an entitlement of the person's partner or former partner under a payment split under Part VIIIB of the <cite>Family Law Act 1975</cite>; or</li>
<li>(v) to the extent necessary to pay a hardship amount; and</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(i) that the income stream cannot be transferred to a person except:</li>
<li>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(i) on the death of the primary beneficiary, to a reversionary beneficiary; or</li>
<li>(ii) on the death of a reversionary beneficiary, to another reversionary beneficiary; and</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(j) that neither the capital value of the income stream, nor the income from it, can be used as security for a borrowing; and</li>
<li>(k) that, if the income stream reverts, it must not have a reversionary component greater than the benefit that was payable immediately before the reversion; and</li>
<li>(l) that, if the income stream is commuted, the commuted amount must not be greater than the benefit that was payable immediately before the commutation.</li>
</ul><p><strong>9A(2A)</strong> A contract, or the governing rules, for the provision to a person of an income stream that meets all of the requirements of <span class="nobr">subsection (2)</span>, except the requirement of <span class="nobr">paragraph (2)(c),</span> are taken to meet the requirements of <span class="nobr">subsection (2)</span> if the contract or governing rules specify that any provision included in the contract or governing rules in accordance with <span class="nobr">paragraph (2)(c)</span> does not apply in any year in which:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(a) the person ceases to receive income under an income stream jointly and begins to receive income under a single income stream; and</li>
<li>(b) the total amount received in the year under the single income stream is less than the total amount received by the person in the previous year but is not nil.</li>
</ul><p><em>Matters not required of income stream</em></p>
<p><strong>9A(3)</strong> For the purpose of determining whether an income stream meets the requirements of <span class="nobr">subsection (2)</span>, it is immaterial that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(a) if the primary beneficiary dies within 10 years after the commencement day of the income stream, a surviving reversionary beneficiary may be paid an amount equal to the total of the payments that the primary beneficiary would (if he or she had not died) have received from the day of the death until the end of the period of 10 years; and</li>
<li>(b) if:<br /><ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>(i) the primary beneficiary dies within 10 years after the commencement day of the income stream; and</li>

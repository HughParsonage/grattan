<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A parent's adjusted taxable income is the total of the following components:</p>
<ul><li><a href="20831#taxable_income">taxable income for the last relevant year of income</a> (including overseas income if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction)</li>
<li><a href="20831#reportable_fringe_benefits">reportable fringe benefits</a> total for that year of income</li>
<li><a href="20831#target_foreign_income">target foreign income</a> for that year of income</li>
<li>the parent's <a href="20831#total_net_investment_loss">total net investment loss</a> for that year of income</li>
<li>the total of the <a href="20831#specified_tax_free_pensions">specified tax free pensions or benefits</a> received in that year of income, and</li>
<li>the parent's <a href="20831#reportable_superannuation_contributions">reportable superannuation contributions.</a></li>
</ul><p>If an application for post separation income (<a href="../child-support-guide/2/5/2">2.5.2</a>) to be excluded from a parent's adjusted taxable income has been accepted then the parent's adjusted taxable income will be the amount determined by the Registrar.</p>
<p>For the purposes of child support, any assessable First Home Super Saver released amounts (within the meaning of the <cite>Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</cite>) for that year of income will be disregarded when working out a parent's adjusted taxable income (CSA Act section 43(1)(a)).</p>
<p>When the Registrar is considering a parent's application for the minimum annual rate to be reduced to nil (CSA Act section 66A) (<a href="../child-support-guide/2/5/4">2.5.4</a>), or the fixed annual rate to not be used (CSA Act section 65B) (<a href="../child-support-guide/2/5/3">2.5.3</a>), a parent's 'income' does not include:</p>
<ul><li><a href="20831#ndis">National Disability Insurance Scheme amounts</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="20831#nrs">National Redress Scheme payments</a>.</li>
</ul><div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03872" title="Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989">CSA Act</a> section 43 Working out parent's adjusted taxable income, section 65B Application for section 65A not to apply, section 66A Registrar may reduce an assessment to nil in certain cases</p>
</div>
<h2 id="taxable_income">Taxable income for the last relevant year of income</h2>
<p>Generally, a parent's taxable income is the amount assessed by the <a href="../child-support-guide/acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a> under an Income Tax Assessment Act for the relevant year of income (see example 1 below). An amended taxable income is taken into account in certain circumstances only - see <a href="../child-support-guide/2/4/4/30">2.4.4.30</a>.</p>
<p>Where a parent has a nil taxable income (whether or not there are carry forward losses) determined under the tax legislation, their adjusted taxable income is taken to be nil for child support purposes unless they have a reportable fringe benefit, target foreign income, total net investment loss, specified tax free pension or benefit or reportable superannuation component for that year of income.</p>
<p>Where a parent has not lodged their tax return, or the ATO has deemed that a parent is not required to lodge a tax return, the Registrar may make a determination of the parent's adjusted taxable income based on the income information available. The rules for determining a parent's adjusted taxable income changed from 1 July 2011 - see <a href="../child-support-guide/2/4/4/40">2.4.4.40</a> for the current rules and <a href="../child-support-guide/2/4/4/50">2.4.4.50</a> for the rules before 1 July 2011. The parent's adjusted taxable income will be the total of their taxable income and other income components. A child support assessment must be amended where the Registrar later ascertains the amount of the parent's adjusted taxable income - see <a href="../child-support-guide/2/4/4/60">2.4.4.60</a>.</p>
<p>The last relevant year of income is the last year of income under Australian taxation law that ended before the start of the child support period.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> If a child support period began on 1 January 2020, the last relevant year of income is 2018-19.</p>
</div>
<p>Where the parent is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (<a href="../child-support-guide/1/5/1">1.5.1</a>), the Registrar can use information about the parent's income in that jurisdiction to determine the parent's overseas income.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Lawson who lives in New Zealand has a new child support period commencing on 1 May 2020. The New Zealand financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March.</p>
<p>As Lawson is a New Zealand resident, New Zealand Inland Revenue Child Support advises the Registrar of Lawson's taxable income for the 2019-20 New Zealand financial year. This information can be used to determine Lawson's overseas income for the last relevant year of income.</p>
<p>See <a href="../child-support-guide/2/4/4/40">2.4.4.40</a> for more detailed information about determination of adjustable taxable incomes.</p>

<p>A parent's reportable fringe benefits total is the amount of reportable fringe benefits as defined in the <cite><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03280">Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986</a></cite> for the year of income.

<h2 id="target_foreign_income">Target foreign income</h2>
<p>Target foreign income is the total of:</p>

<h2 id="total_net_investment_loss">Total net investment loss</h2>
<p>The description of this income component at section 43(1)(d) of the CSA Act refers to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, which includes this definition of the term at section 995.1 of that Act:</p>
<p>'total net investment loss' of an individual for an income year means the sum of:</p>
<ol><li>the amount (if any) by which the individual's deductions for the income year that are attributable to financial investments exceed the individual's gross income for that year from those investments, and</li>
<li>the amount (if any) by which the individual's deductions for the income year that are attributable to rental property exceed the individual's gross income for that year from rental property.</li>
</ol><p>Financial investments include shares, managed investment schemes, forestry managed investment schemes, and a right or option in respect of any such investment.</p>
<p>In calculating the loss amount relevant to financial investments the gross income and related deductions are considered to determine if there is a net financial investment loss. A similar exercise is undertaken to identify if there is a net rental property loss. Both loss amounts (if any) are then added together to identify the total net investment loss.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> If Kristyna has an income from wages of $40,000, an income from financial investments of $15,000 and investment deductions of $10,000, Kristyna's taxable income is $45,000. As Kristyna's investment deductions do not exceed Kristyna's investment income, there is no investment loss. Kristyna's adjusted taxable income is $45,000 for child support purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> If Brooke has an income from wages of $40,000, an income from financial investments of $15,000 and investment deductions of $20,000, Brooke's taxable income is $35,000. The investment loss of $5,000 is then added back to Brooke's taxable income to arrive at an adjusted taxable income of $40,000 for child support purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> If Andre has an income from wages of $10,000 and a net rental property loss of $15,000, Andre's taxable income is $0. The net rental property loss of $15,000 is then added back to Andre's taxable income of $0 to arrive at an adjusted taxable income of $15,000 for child support purposes.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Prior to the 2009-10 financial year only net losses incurred in relation to rental property investments were included when calculating an adjusted taxable income.</p>

<h2 id="ndis">National Disability Insurance Scheme amounts</h2>
<p>A National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) amount (as defined under the <cite>National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</cite>) is for the purpose of reasonable and necessary supports funded under a participant's plan.</p>
<p>NDIS payments received by NDIS participants are non-taxable, although any bank interest earned from the payments is taxable. Accordingly, NDIS payments are not 'taxable income' and are not part of a person's adjusted taxable income for general child support purposes.</p>
<p>When the Registrar is considering a parent's application for the minimum annual rate to be reduced to nil (CSA Act section 66A) (<a href="../child-support-guide/2/5/4">2.5.4</a>), or the fixed annual rate to not be used (CSA Act section 65B) (<a href="../child-support-guide/2/5/3">2.5.3</a>), any income earned, derived or received by the parent must be considered, except certain prescribed payments within CSA Regs section 13. An NDIS amount is a prescribed payment under section 13 of the CSA Regs, and therefore, NDIS amounts are excluded from the definition of 'income' for these child support decisions.</p>

<h1 >2.1.3.50 Healthy Start for School requirements (FTB)</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If an individual or their partner receives an income support payment on any day that the individual is also receiving FTB Part A, and they have an FTB child that turns 4 in that income year, an age-appropriate health check must be undertaken or the FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/f/58">1.1.F.58</a>).</p>
<p>This topic covers the following:</p>
<ul><li>FTB individuals affected by the health check requirement,</li>
<li>timeframe for completing the health check,</li>
<li>children taken to meet the health check requirement, and</li>
<li>consequences of failing to meet the health check requirement.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999">FAAct</a> section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied</p>
<h2>FTB individuals affected by the health check requirement</h2>
<p>An individual who is the parent (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/p/10">1.1.P.10</a>) of an FTB child, or who is partnered to the parent of an FTB child, and they or their partner receives an income support payment (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/1/1/i/50">1.1.I.50</a>) on any day that they are also receiving FTB, and that FTB child turns 4 in an income year, they are required to make sure their child has undergone the recognised health check (<a href="../family-assistance-guide/2/1/3/70">2.1.3.70</a>) and notify Centrelink that the health check requirement is met before the child's fifth birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Where an income support payment is retrospectively paid for a period during the income year in which the child turns or has turned 4, this can cause the health check requirement to apply to the individual.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999">FAAct</a> section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied</p>
</div>
<h2>Timeframe for completing the health check</h2>
<p>From 2018-19, for income years in which a child turns 4, a recognised health check must be completed and Centrelink must be notified before the day on which the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Jayde turns 4 in the 2018-19 income year on 3 December 2018. The health check must be completed and Centrelink notified by 2 December 2019.</p>
</div>
<p>For income years prior to 2018-19, the health check must be completed and Centrelink must be notified by the end of the first income year after the income year in which the child turned 4.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Ebony turns 4 in the 2017-18 income year. The health check must be completed and Centrelink notified by 30 June 2019.</p>
</div>
<p>If the child dies at any time within the 1 year timeframe for income years prior to 2018-19, the health check requirement will not apply in relation to the child and the individual entitled to FTB Part A in relation to the child will receive the FTB Part A supplement for the relevant income year as normal. Similarly, for income years from 2018-19, if the child dies before their fifth birthday or any later days determined by Centrelink, the health check requirement will not apply in relation to that child and the FTB child rate will not be reduced.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999">FAAct</a> section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied, section 61D Death of an FTB child</p>
</div>
<h2>Children taken to meet the health check requirement</h2>
<p>Where the FTB child is taking or has already undertaken health assessments suitable to their particular circumstances, the child is taken to meet the health check requirement. In these cases an additional health assessment is not required.</p>
<p>Children in this category are:</p>
<ul><li>From 2018-19 onwards, a child who qualifies their carer for <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#cp" title="Carer payment">CP</a>, <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#ca" title="Carer allowance">CA</a> or a <a href="../family-assistance-guide/acronyms#hcc" title="Health care card">HCC</a> (because the carer is qualified for CA for the child, either alone or with another care receiver) at any time from the beginning of the income year in which the child turned 4 to the day before the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday).</li>
<li>From 2018-19 onwards, a child assessed by a medical practitioner as having a severe disability or severe medical condition and who has undergone, during the period beginning the day the child turns 3 and ending the day before the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday) a health assessment suitable to their needs conducted by a suitably qualified health professional.</li>
</ul><div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999">FAAct</a> section 61A(9) Legislative instrument</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2018L00877">Family Tax Benefit (Meeting the Health Check Requirement) Determination 2018</a> section 8 Classes of children taken to meet the health check requirement</p>
</div>
<h2>Consequences of failing to meet the health check requirement</h2>
<p>From 1 July 2018, a reduction to an individual's FTB child rate will be applied from the child's fifth birthday if the health check requirement is not met, or if the individual does not notify Centrelink that a health check has been completed, by the child's fifth birthday. The reduction will apply for the corresponding number of days that an individual or their partner received FTB Part A and an income support payment during the income year the child turned 4.</p>
<p>An individual may have until a later day determined by Centrelink by which to meet the health check requirement. This later day can be no later than the child's sixth birthday.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00490" title="A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999">FAAct</a> section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied</p>
</div>
<h2>Children taken to meet the health check requirement 2012-13 to 2017-18</h2>
<p>Where the FTB child is taking or has already undertaken health assessments suitable to their particular circumstances, the child is taken to meet the health check requirement. In these cases an additional health assessment is not required.</p>
<p>Children in this category are:</p>
<ul><li>For income years from 2012-13 to 2017-18, a child who qualifies their carer for CP, CA or a HCC (because the carer is qualified for CA for the child, either alone or with another care receiver) during the income year in which the child turns 4 or within the following income year.</li>
<li>For income years from 2012-13 to 2017-18, a child assessed by a medical practitioner as having a severe disability or severe medical condition and who has undergone, within the period from when the child turned 3 years of age, until the end of the second income year after the income year in which the child turned 4, an assessment suitable to their needs conducted by a suitably qualified health professional for income years prior to 2012-13. Similarly, if the child is assessed by a medical practitioner as above before the end of the first income year where the relevant income year is 2012-13 or later the same rule applies.</li>
</ul><h2>Consequences of failing to meet the health check requirement for income years 2012-13 to 2017-18</h2>
<p>If the health check requirement applies and is not met, or the individual does not notify Centrelink that a health check has been completed by the end of the first income year after their child turned 4 for income years from 2012-13 to 2017-18, part or all of their FTB Part A supplement for the child will be withheld, even if the individual meets the tax lodgement requirements for that income year.</p>
<p>The individual's FTB Part A supplement will be reviewed if the health check requirement is met by the end of the first income year after the income year in which their child turned 4 for income years 2012-13 to 2017-18.</p>

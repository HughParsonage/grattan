<p>Parenting payment is an income support payment for people who are caring for children regardless of their marital status. It replaced sole parent pension and parenting allowance on 20 March 1998. Previously, sole parent pension was paid to lone parents and parenting allowance was paid to partnered parents.</p>
<p>A number of conditions that previously varied between sole parent pension and parenting allowance have been aligned under parenting payment. The main conditions aligned were:</p>
<ul><li>extending the non-tapered assets test to lone parents;</li>
<li>extending the income maintenance period to lone parents (under which lump sum leave payments, such as accrued annual leave and long service leave, are treated as income for a period equal to the period of unused leave paid by the employer);</li>
<li>introducing a maximum temporary absence period from Australia of 26 weeks; and</li>

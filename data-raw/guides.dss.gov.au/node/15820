<p>From 1 July 2012 DSP recipients with a permanent and severe impairment and no future work capacity are eligible for indefinite portability of their pension. A DSP recipient may be granted indefinite portability if the JCA indicates that, based on the evidence and the assessor's professional opinion, it is unlikely they will have any capacity to undertake work in the open employment market at or above the relevant minimum wage in the next 5 years, even with interventions. DSP recipients applying for portability under these provisions are required to undergo an assessment of their impairment and their future work capacity in Australia prior to departure.</p>

<h2>General Portability for DSP - 4 weeks in a 12-month period</h2>
<p>The table below explains the 4 weeks, in a rolling 12-month period, portability provisions for DSP recipients who do not qualify for unlimited portability.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Situation</th>
<th scope="col">Description</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Departure from Australia before 1 January 2015</td>
<td>
<p>DSP recipients who left Australia prior to 1 January 2015 will be paid under the current 6-week portability rules for that trip.</p>
<p>DSP recipient outside Australia on 1 January 2015, will have the days accruing from 1 January 2015 counted as part of the 4-week portability period.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Sam is receiving DSP and departed from Australia on a 40 day overseas trip on 17 December 2014 (first day of his 12-month period). He expects to return to Australia on 26 January 2015. Because Sam was overseas on 1 January 2015, the period overseas from 1 January 2015 up to and including 25 January 2015 will count towards the 4-week portability period. Therefore Sam will have 3 days portability remaining from the 12-month period.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
<p>Multiple trips within the 12-month period</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>DSP recipients can generally travel overseas, and retain their pension, for up to 4 weeks in a 12-month period. The 4 weeks general portability period can comprise a number of shorter trips, provided the total overseas travel does not exceed 4 weeks (28 days) in a 12-month period. The 4 weeks excludes days when the person was not on payment or the person has an approved temporary absence.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> In April 2015, James (DSP recipient) and his carer Chris travelled to Fiji for 7 days. On their return they booked a further overseas trip to Bali for 14 days, from 15 July 2015. In November 2015 they were invited to a wedding in Thailand and decided to use the balance of their 4-week portability entitlement. James and Chris were able to take advantage of the opportunity to take multiple trips in the 12-month period.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
<p>Rolling 12-month periods</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The period of 12 months is determined on a rolling basis. For example, if a DSP recipient departs Australia on a temporary overseas trip on 1 May 2015 the 12-month portability entitlement period commences from that date and ends on 30 April 2016. If the person does not depart overseas again until 20 December 2018, then the 12-month period will commence from that date. Approved temporary absences do not count towards this 12-month rolling period.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Robyn purchased tickets for a 4-week cruise around New Zealand which departed on 1 May 2015. Robyn has used her 4-week portability entitlement for the 12-month period and will not be able to travel, and retain her full rate of payment, before 30 April 2016 (unless special circumstances apply). Robyn did not travel overseas again until 20 December 2018. Her 4-week portability period would commence from that date.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
<p>Approved temporary absences</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>In limited circumstances, defined in the legislation, a person may be granted an approved temporary absence of up to 4 weeks. These circumstances include attending an acute family crisis, seeking medical treatment not available in Australia or for a defined humanitarian purpose. If required, a DSP recipient can add all or part of their general 4-week portabillity period (if available) to the end of their approved temporary absence without the need to return to Australia first.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Lucy has a very rare genetic disorder which cannot be treated in Australia. She used 2 weeks of her 4-week portability period in February 2015 on a holiday. She therefore only had another 2 weeks general portability of her DSP until February 2016. Lucy applied to Centrelink for an approved temporary absence of 3 weeks to go to the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#uk" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> in July 2015 to receive the medical treatment, unavailable in Australia. Lucy wished to then spend another 2 weeks after her treatment holidaying in Europe. Lucy continued to receive her DSP for the 5-week period, the first 3 weeks as an approved temporary absence and the last 2 weeks as part of her general 4-week portability.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
<p>Overseas absences of more than 4 weeks in a 12-month period</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>DSP recipients who travel overseas for more than 4 weeks in a 12-month period will have their payment suspended unless they:</p>
<ul><li>have an approved temporary absence (limited to those approved reasons)</li>
<li>are studying overseas as part of a full-time Australian course</li>
<li>are severely disabled and dependent on and living with, a family member who has been temporarily posted to work outside Australia</li>
<li>are severely disabled and DSP can be paid under an international social security agreement</li>
<li>have been assessed in Australia prior to departure as having a permanent, severe impairment and no future work capacity, or</li>
<li>been granted an extension to their portability period.</li>
</ul><p>They will not be eligible to be back paid for any unapproved period in excess of 4 weeks that they spend overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the DSP recipient's payment has been suspended and they remain overseas beyond 13 weeks from the date of suspension, without an approved absence, their payment will be cancelled and they will have to reapply for the payment on their return to Australia.</p>

<h2>Portability of Age for recipients with a qualifying residence exemption</h2>
<p>Refugees and former refugees are exempted from qualifying residence criterion for Age. As the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#qre" title="Qualifying residence exemption">QRE</a> only applies when the recipient resides in Australia, the pension is portable for temporary absences only. If the recipient has not accumulated 10 years of residence before departure and the overseas absence is not temporary, the recipient will not be able to meet the residence criterion and will lose qualification for the pension. Long-term absences that are in reality permanent should be treated as such.</p>

</div>
<h2>Acute family crisis</h2>
<p>A recipient's overseas absence for the purpose of attending to an acute family crisis can be for a limited and specified period of time. The delegate must be satisfied that the absence is:</p>
<ul><li>for the purpose of visiting a family member who is critically ill, or</li>
<li>for the purpose of visiting a family member who is hospitalised with a serious illness, or</li>
<li>for a purpose relating to the death of a family member, or</li>
<li>for a purpose relating to a life-threatening situation (other than an illness referred to in the first 2 dot points) that
<ul><li>is facing a family member, and</li>
<li>is beyond the control of the family member.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>If the recipient's circumstances satisfy the acute family crisis criteria then payments may continue only for a reasonable amount of time (up to the allowed portability period for the qualifying payment) for the recipient to visit an ill family member, deal with a family member's death or to deal with a life threatening situation.</p>
<p>2 weeks will normally be sufficient for a recipient to visit a family member who is critically ill or who has been hospitalised with a serious illness.</p>
<p>The criteria for an acute family crisis (as provided by the legislation) indicates that, in most cases, the circumstances under which payment can be made while a recipient is overseas will be due to an immediate or emergency family situation. Consideration must be given to the meaning of the term 'acute' when assessing a critical or serious illness. An illness that quickly becomes very severe should be contrasted with a chronic condition. In the normal course of events a recipient wishing to visit a family member suffering from an ongoing medical condition is not covered by this provision.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The recipient's family member is currently critically ill.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The recipient's family member is hospitalised with a serious illness.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> The recipient's family member is currently facing a life threatening situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> The recipient's family member has recently died.</p>
</div>
<p>Where the circumstances relate to the death of a family member, however, and subject to decision maker's satisfaction that the main reason for the travel relates to the death of a family member, consideration can be given to paying the recipient while overseas at any time after the family member's death, even when the travel is not in the period immediately following the death of the family member.</p>
<p>Applicable situations where overseas travel might relate to the death of a family member and where the circumstances are not immediate or an emergency, could include the following scenarios:</p>
<ul><li>where a funeral or memorial service for the recipient's deceased family member is delayed due to factors outside the recipient's control</li>
<li>where the body of the recipient's deceased family member is found after being missing or is released after being held for purposes relating to a legal investigation, or</li>
<li>where the recipient was unfit for travel immediately after the family member's death (the recipient must have sufficient medical evidence to demonstrate that they were unfit for travel at the earlier time).</li>
</ul><p>The decision maker may also give consideration to paying the recipient while overseas if the recipient's family member is facing a life threatening situation which is beyond the family member's control.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A family member is taken hostage.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A family member has been subjected to a creditable threat upon their life.</p>
</div>
<p>If the recipient's circumstances satisfy the criteria for an acute family crisis, then they may be paid while overseas for a specific negotiated period of no longer than the allowed portability period for the qualifying payment. The length of payment will be restricted to the period of time required for the recipient to deal with the particular acute family crisis.</p>
<p>Recipients who wish to remain overseas following an approved visit to provide ongoing care to a family member are no longer considered to be 'visiting' and cease to be payable under this provision.</p>
<div class="reference">

</div>
<h2>Humanitarian purpose</h2>
<p>A recipient's overseas absence for a humanitarian purpose can be for a limited and specified period of time if the recipient is:</p>
<ul><li>involved in custody proceedings</li>
<li>adopting a child</li>
<li>involved in legal proceedings other than those in respect of a crime allegedly committed by the recipient</li>
<li>a formally selected member of the Australian Paralympic Team, for participation as a competitor, at the international athletic competition known as the Paralympic Games</li>
<li>in receipt of a DSP and is attending a lead-up event to prepare or qualify as a competitor at the international athletic competition known as the Paralympic Games, within 12 months prior to a Paralympic Games, or</li>
<li>attending a memorial service that has been approved by the Australian Government to commemorate an event involving the death or serious injury of an Australian resident, if the recipient is the person who was seriously injured at that event, or is a family member of a person who died or was seriously injured at that event.</li>
</ul><p>Other legal proceedings include circumstances such as where a recipient is required to appear as a witness.</p>
<p>DSP can continue overseas for additional approved periods of up to 4 weeks at a time in the 12 months prior to the Paralympic Games for the purpose of attending a lead-up event. Verification of the event details and attendance requirements is required by an appropriate body (e.g. Australian Sports Commission) approved by the Department responsible for Sport.</p>
<p>If the recipient's circumstances satisfy the humanitarian purpose criteria, then payments may continue for a specific negotiated period of no longer than the allowed portability period for the qualifying payment. The length of payment will be restricted to the period of time required for the recipient to deal with the particular humanitarian purpose.</p>

</div>
<h2>Eligible medical treatment</h2>
<p>Eligible medical treatment, in relation to a recipient, means medical treatment of a kind that is not available to the recipient in Australia. It could include specialised or new types of surgery such as transplants or other kinds of treatment. Such a determination would be guided by the opinions of registered Australian medical practitioners. However, treatment does not necessarily satisfy the definition of eligible medical treatment just because a doctor approves or recommends the treatment. For example, iridology, herbal treatment, faith healing and similar treatments are not considered to be eligible medical treatment.</p>
<p>If the recipient's circumstances satisfy the eligible medical treatment criteria, then payments may continue for a specific negotiated period of no longer than the allowed portability period for the qualifying payment. The length of payment will be restricted to the period of time required to complete the treatment, including recuperation and any allowances that must be made for return travel.</p>

</div>
<h2>Recipient class - full-time student</h2>
<p>YA portability rules depend on whether a recipient is undertaking approved full-time study.</p>
<h2>Full-time students &amp; Australian Apprentices going overseas for the purpose of undertaking study or training as part of their full-time Australian course or apprenticeship</h2>
<p>Recipients of JSP, YA, Austudy, PP, DSP, CP, WA and PA who are going overseas for the purpose of undertaking study as a part of their full-time Australian course may be paid for the entire duration of the study. If a student is going overseas for this purpose it is a requirement that they provide evidence that their overseas study can be credited towards their Australian course.</p>
<p>Recipients of PP, CP, WA and PA may also access portability provisions for periods totalling 6 weeks. The total period of 6 weeks can be taken at the beginning and/or end of their study (except for YA (student), Austudy and DSP).</p>
<p>From 1 January 2015:</p>
<ul><li>YA and Austudy are not portable unless the student is undertaking approved/qualifying overseas study as a part of their full-time Australian course.</li>
<li>DSP is portable for a total of up to 4 weeks in a 12-month period. DSP can be paid for a longer period in the case of approved overseas study that is part of a full-time course in Australia.</li>
<li>YA, Austudy, DSP students can continue to access 6 weeks portability if they departed Australia before 1 January 2015. Recipients who return to Australia on or after 1 January 2015 are subject to the new portability rules for any subsequent trips overseas.</li>
</ul><p>From 1 January 2013:</p>
<ul><li>YA and Austudy recipients were eligible to remain on payment while overseas for up to 6 weeks without limitation. The 6-week portability period was in addition to any time spent undertaking eligible overseas study or training.</li>
</ul><p>Prior to 1 January 2013:</p>
<ul><li>the portability period for YA, Austudy and DSP was 13 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>Australian Apprentices in receipt of YA, Austudy, PP, DSP, CP, WA and PA will continue to be paid as long as they are working or training overseas in their Australian Apprenticeship and they continue to satisfy the definition of an Australian Apprentice (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/a/324">1.1.A.324</a>).</p>
<p>Nothing in the portability provisions confer a right for a person to continue to be paid overseas if they are not qualified for their payment. It is therefore important to always check that the overseas absence does not interfere with the person remaining qualified for the payment.</p>
<p>Where a person's payment is suspended, payment can be reinstated with respect to the period that the Secretary is satisfied that the person is absent from Australia for the purpose of undertaking studies as part of their full-time Australian course.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Raymond is receiving Austudy and decides to go overseas for a holiday to India. On leaving Australia, Raymond's Austudy is suspended. After 4 weeks overseas Raymond contacts Centrelink and says that he wishes to stay overseas to undertake study as part of his Australian course. Raymond is able to provide Centrelink with the relevant documentation showing that his overseas study can be credited towards his full-time Australian course and that his 16-week study period will start immediately. In line with SSAct section 1218(2) Raymond's Austudy can be reinstated once he commences studying in India. He can receive his payment for 16 weeks, being for the period of eligible overseas study. In this scenario, Raymond's maximum portability period ceases once his approved overseas study period ends.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Julie is qualified for DSP. Under SSAct section 1218(2) Centrelink has granted Julie a 15-week portability period for the purpose of overseas study. At week 14 Julie contacts Centrelink from overseas and asks whether it is possible for her to stay overseas for a further 4-week holiday in Thailand. As Julie's approved overseas study portability period began from the date she left Australia, once she has completed her overseas study she has been paid for more than 4 weeks in a 12-month period. Payment will stop once the overseas study period has been completed if Julie chooses to remain outside Australia.</p>
</div>
<h2>Commencing student payments overseas</h2>
<h3>Continuing students</h3>
<p>A continuing full-time student, currently not receiving YA or Austudy, who intends to undertake a study period overseas, which can be credited towards their approved Australian course, can commence receiving YA or Austudy overseas. (e.g. a secondary school student who transitions to university in the next study period). Students need to lodge their claim for YA or Austudy before they depart Australia. Their YA or Austudy claim can be granted while they are overseas studying, subject to them satisfying the eligibility requirements.</p>
<h3>New students</h3>
<p>A person, who is not currently studying and then enrols in an approved course, cannot commence receiving YA or Austudy overseas where they have not undertaken any domestic study in the period immediately prior to departing Australia (e.g. a person takes a gap year and starts their first study period of the course overseas).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Ben is not currently receiving YA but is studying engineering full-time at university and intends to undertake an overseas study period in his next semester that will be credited towards his approved Australian course. He makes a claim for YA prior to leaving Australia. Centrelink has granted Ben a 15-week portability period for the purpose of overseas study in Beijing, China. Ben departs Australia, starts his overseas study period and commences to receive his YA payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Hayley is 21 years of age and studying teaching full-time at university. She is currently not eligible to receive YA due to the parental means-testing arrangements. Hayley is granted approval by her university to undertake the next semester of her course in Germany (it will be credited towards her approved Australian course). She makes a claim for YA prior to leaving Australia (within 13 weeks of her 22nd birthday) and departs Australia one week later. Two weeks after arriving in Germany Hayley turns 22 years of age. Centrelink grants Hayley independent YA and a 15-week portability period for the purpose of overseas study in Germany starting from her 22nd birthday.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Fergus is 18 years of age living in his family home while he studies journalism full-time at university. He is currently not eligible to receive dependent YA due to the YA living at home parental means-testing arrangements. Fergus is granted approval by his university to undertake the next semester of his course in Barbados (it will be credited towards his approved Australian course). He makes a claim for dependent YA prior to leaving Australia (within 13 weeks of starting his overseas study period) and departs Australia one week later and commences living away from home. Fergus has been assessed by Centrelink as satisfying the YA living away from home parental means-testing arrangements. Centrelink grants Fergus dependent YA and a 13-week portability period for the purpose of overseas study in Barbados.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> Susan has finished secondary school and takes a gap year. After her gap year Susan decides to commence full-time study in an approved arts performance course at an approved Australian university (she is not a continuing student). Susan decides that she wants to undertake her first study period in Washington DC, USA (which can be credited towards her Australian course). Susan makes her claim for YA and departs Australia. Susan's overseas study period commences before the first day of her university's domestic study period. Susan cannot commence receiving YA overseas as she is not undertaking full-time study prior to departing Australia (she is not a continuing student).</p>

<h2>Student overseas travel time</h2>
<p>The following factors may provide guidance in determining how many days of travelling time a student should be granted:</p>
<ul><li>the reasonable time required to relocate using the most practical mode of travel available, and</li>
<li>the remoteness of the study or training location, and</li>
<li>whether the student has a disability that will substantially impact on their ability to relocate, and</li>
<li>any other relevant factors that will reasonably justify the granting of extra travel time.</li>
</ul><p>Generally, a student or apprentice will not require more than 10 days total travel time in order to relocate to and from their overseas study or training location. This additional travel time may not be used to extend a holiday before or after the study period.</p>

<h2>Return rules affecting full-time students going overseas for study as part of their full-time Australian course</h2>
<p>Full-time students qualified for YA, Austudy, PP, CP, WA and PA who are going overseas to study as part of their full-time Australian course can return to Australia for a period of up to 6 weeks without affecting the continuity of their portability period. This means a new portability period does not start unless the return to Australia is greater than 6 weeks.</p>

<h2>Portability extension for DSP recipients whose family member is posted overseas for work</h2>
<p>The legislation allows for a portability extension in circumstances where the person is receiving DSP and has a family member who has been posted overseas for work. The conditions under which a portability extension can be permitted for this purpose is specified in SSAct section 1218AB, and requires that all of the following qualifying circumstances must exist:</p>
<ul><li>The person is severely disabled.</li>
<li>The person is receiving DSP.</li>
<li>The person is wholly or substantially dependent on a family member of the person.</li>
<li>The person will be living with the family member of the person throughout the period of absence.</li>
<li>The family member of the person is engaged in employment in Australia for an employer immediately before the start of the period of absence.</li>
<li>The family member of the person will be engaged in employment outside Australia for the same employer throughout the period of absence.</li>
</ul><p>A portability extension for this purpose should be for a defined period taking account of the length of the overseas posting. In most cases the extension period will not exceed 3 years. If a DSP recipient returns to Australia for a short visit during their extended portability period this return will not affect their extension period and a new decision is not required on a subsequent departure within this existing extension period.</p>
<p>In limited circumstances it may be possible for a person to be granted another extension at the end of their portability period. This could happen where the family member has their overseas posting extended. In these cases care should be taken to ensure that the DSP recipient continues to meet the residency qualification requirements for DSP.</p>
<p>The table below explains portability extension for DSP recipients whose family member is posted overseas.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Situation</th>
<th scope="col">Description</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The person is severely disabled.</td>
<td>To determine whether a DSP recipient is severely disabled refer to <a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/s/110">1.1.S.110</a> or SSAct section 23(4B).</td>
</tr><tr><td>The person is receiving DSP.</td>
<td>
<p>To be eligible for a portability extension under this provision a person must be receiving DSP. This provision is not available to DSP recipients whose payments have already ceased whilst outside Australia. However, if a retrospective decision is being made giving the person continuous entitlement for the period of absence from Australia then their payment can be restored and arrears paid as long as there is no break in entitlement.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Sharon is on DSP and has travelled to Chile with her mother. Her mother works for the <a href="../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#dfat" title="Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade">DFAT</a> and has been posted to work at the Australian Embassy in Santiago for 1 year. Her DSP is suspended 4 weeks after she left Australia. Even though Sharon's DSP has been suspended, she qualifies for an extension because she is living with her mother who she is substantially dependent on. Sharon's DSP can be restored from the suspension date because there is no break in entitlement.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>The person is wholly or substantially dependent on a family member of the person.</td>
<td>
<p>Wholly or substantially dependent means that the family member provides ongoing care and attention or manages the financial affairs of the DSP recipient. It will also include situations where the DSP recipient is subject to a guardianship order and is in the legal care of the family member. Ordinarily the DSP recipient would be living in Australia with the family member who they are dependent on prior to commencement of the posting outside Australia.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Josh is a severely disabled DSP recipient who lives with his sister in her house in Australia. Whilst Josh is severely disabled he doesn't require 24 hour care, but he is dependent on his sister to provide his accommodation, food, and emotional support. Josh is considered to be substantially dependent on his sister.</p>
</div>
<p>The definition of a family member is provided in SSAct subsection 23(14) or <a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/f/60">1.1.F.60</a>. A family member includes the partner, parent, sibling, or a child of the relevant person. It may also include any other person who, in the opinion of the Secretary, should be treated for the purposes of this definition as a partner, parent, sibling or child of the relevant person. This may cover situations such as stepchildren or foster children.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>The person will be living with the family member of the person throughout the period of absence.</td>
<td>
<p>A DSP recipient is living with a family member if they are part of the same household and share the same accommodation. A person can still be regarded as living together even though they may occasionally spend some time apart. For example, the DSP recipient may wish to visit friends while overseas. However, this would not break the continuity of the relationship as long as the DSP recipient ordinarily shares the same accommodation as the family member during the absence.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Mel receives DSP and is in Spain with her daughter who has been posted to work there for a period of 2 years. Mel decides to travel to the UK for 2 weeks to visit a friend. As she is ordinarily living with and still substantially dependent on her daughter and only away for a short period, her payment may continue under this provision. If Mel decided to stay on in the UK with her friend for a longer period, her circumstances would need to be reviewed to assess if she is still living with and substantially dependent on her daughter.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
<ul><li>The family member of the person is engaged in employment in Australia for an employer immediately before the start of the period of absence, and</li>
<li>The family member of the person will be engaged in employment outside Australia for the same employer throughout the period of absence.</li>
</ul></td>
<td>
<p>This provision is intended to cover DSP recipients whose family member has been posted overseas for work. It does not include situations where a family member is going overseas to take up work for a new employer.</p>
<p>The key consideration is to ensure that the family member is currently employed in Australia and is taking up an appointment overseas with the same employer.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Cathy works for the Australian Defence Force in Australia, so she is a federal government public servant. She takes up a position to work for DFAT in Cambodia for 18 months. Cathy would be considered to be working for the same employer.</p>
</div>
<p>A person is engaged in employment if they are under a contract of service to an employer and ordinarily receive employment income from remunerative work undertaken by the person. Employment income includes (but is not limited to): salary, wages, commissions, fringe benefits, bonus payments, leave payments etc. A person is not engaged in employment if they are in receipt of supported wages. Volunteers and missionaries are not regarded as being engaged in employment unless they can provide evidence that they are under a contract of service and receive monetary remuneration for their work. A person engaged in employment will need to provide acceptable evidence such as a letter from their employer to confirm their current place of employment and overseas posting. A person who takes leave without pay from their work would still be considered to be engaged in employment provided they are still employed by the same employer.</p>
<p>The word employer means a person who pays or is liable to pay any salary or wages to an employee. In general, this provision does not extend to a person that is self-employed or working as a private contractor unless they can provide evidence of a continuing relationship between their work in Australia and overseas.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Phil is a self-employed shipwright who specialises in renovating old fishing boats and does the majority of his work for the same shipping company in Australia. This company has requested that Phil be based in Indonesia for the next 18 months to refurbish some vessels they have purchased. Although Phil is self-employed he is able to provide evidence of his ongoing contractual arrangements with this company. Although Phil is self-employed he would be considered to be working overseas for the same employer as in Australia.</p>

<h2>Portability under international social security agreements (<a href="../guide-social-security-law/1/1/a/120">1.1.A.120</a>)</h2>
<p>Some DSP, CP and PPS recipients who go to a country with which Australia has an international social security agreement may be transferred and paid under the agreement. Some agreements allow for longer or shorter portability of these payments than the domestic legislation, for example New Zealand.</p>
<p>Not all agreements cover these payment types. Agreements generally have more limited categories of people covered. Check each agreement for the payments and types of persons covered.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> PPS is only available to people whose partner has died and sometimes only to women whose legal husband died.</p>
</div>
<p>A new claim does not need to be lodged to affect the transfer. If the transfer is approved, the new pension will be paid at a rate set by the agreement.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A recipient who is in an agreement country and ceases to qualify for DSP after being absent from Australia for 4 weeks, may be eligible to transfer to an agreement DSP payment if the agreement provides for it.</p>

<p>The DOP material in the Guide is being changed to reflect changes to the definition of a double orphan child and the introduction of an additional component of DOP. DOP will now be paid for double orphan children whose only living parent is on remand and charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for ten years or more. An additional component of DOP will now be paid for children who became double orphans on or after 1/7/98 and the rate of family assistance paid to the current family in respect of the child is less than the rate of family assistance paid in respect of the child in their original family.</p>
<p>The changes will include creating a new topic called 5.1.4.70 DOP - Additional Component. This topic will explain how the additional component is calculated.</p>

<p>Verifying Treatment as Not Being a Member of a Couple:</p>
<p>Under section 24 of the SSA, a delegate can decide that a partnered person should be treated as single for a special reason. This amendment will insert a short paragraph stressing the importance of keeping section 24 cases under strict review. The new paragraph will note that the purpose of the review is to identify whether it is appropriate to continue to apply section 24, or whether the person's circumstances have changed so that it is no longer appropriate to apply the discretion.</p>

<p>CDEP CPS Advance Payments</p>
<p>CDEP participants will not be able to receive an advance of income support because they will not be receiving a sufficiently high enough rate of allowance to meet the qualification requirements for an advance.</p>
<p>Pensioners are already able to qualify for an advance. When their CDEP wages are deducted dollar for dollar from their pension, their continued eligibility for an advance depends on how much pension they are receiving and whether they receive sufficient amounts of pension to qualify for an advance.</p>

<p>Policy reference: The Guide, Part 7, Portability</p>
<p>However, normal rules regarding CPS allowable breaks also apply here, so that if a person is overseas for more than three fortnights then the CPS is no longer payable as they have lost their basic qualification for CPS.'</p>

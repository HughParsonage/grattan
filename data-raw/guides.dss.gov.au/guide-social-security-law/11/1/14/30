<h1 >11.1.14.30 Principal carer exemptions from income management - financial vulnerability test</h1>
<h2>Financial vulnerability</h2>
<p>As well as demonstrating suitable care and education of children in their care, principal carers of school-aged or under school-aged children must exhibit no indicators of financial vulnerability during the 12-month period ending immediately before the test time in order to be granted an exemption from income management.</p>
<p>A number of indicators should be considered to build an overall picture of a person's financial circumstances, to assess whether they are able to meet their priority needs and those of their family, to manage their money, and to be safe from financial exploitation in the absence of income management. The delegate should consider any evidence that the indicators exist and, where relevant, review and discuss each factor with the person. Each factor may or may not indicate financial vulnerability, depending on the discussion with the person. Some factors will not be relevant to the person, or the delegate may have no evidence about a particular factor. It is not expected that the delegate will cover all the possible discussion points listed. The delegate will document the discussion with the person and balance the factors, to make a decision as to whether there were indicators of financial vulnerability in the previous 12 months.</p>
<h2>Decision-making principles</h2>
<p>The principles for determining that there were no indicators of financial vulnerability in relation to a person during the previous 12 months are:</p>
<ul><li>a person has been applying appropriate resources to meet their priority needs and the priority needs of their family</li>
<li>a person has been using money management strategies (such as stable payment patterns and budgeting practices) to manage their financial resources, and it is likely the person will continue to do so in the future</li>
<li>a person had control over their money and was not subject to financial exploitation</li>
<li>a person did not regularly require urgent funds to pay for foreseeable costs, and did not frequently change their income support pay dates. Consideration must be given to the reasons for seeking the urgent payments or changing the payment dates.</li>
</ul><h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>For the purposes of the assessment:</p>
<ul><li>financial exploitation: where a person is subject to undue pressure, harassment, violence, abuse, deception or exploitation for resources by another person or people, including other family members and community members</li>
<li>priority needs: for the purposes of income management, priority needs are those defined in SS(Admin)Act section 123TH.</li>
</ul><div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00580" title="Social Security (Administration) Act 1999">SS(Admin)Act</a> section 123TH Priority needs</p>
</div>
<h2>Guidelines for assessing financial vulnerability</h2>
<p>The delegate needs to be satisfied that the person had, over the last 12 months, shown no signs of financial vulnerability, with regard to the considerations set out below.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These considerations are intended to create an overall impression of a person's financial circumstances, and no set weight should be attributed to each. Each factor should be considered, and those that are relevant taken into account. The considerations should not be treated as a checklist and the discussion points do not necessarily indicate that a person is financially vulnerable. The questions are designed to identify whether a person has faced any significant financial challenges and whether they have been able to manage their money to effectively deal with those challenges or should be considered financially vulnerable as a result.</p>

If documentary evidence is required (i.e. evidence of attendance at a money management course), it is the responsibility of the person requesting the exemption to provide this evidence to Centrelink.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Costas is receiving <a href="../../../acronyms#pp" title="Parenting payment">PP</a> and is income managed under the Long-term Welfare Payment Recipient Measure. He applies for an exemption from income management and the delegate applies the financial vulnerability test. Costas informs the delegate that he does not know how to set a budget, and that he often forgets to pay his bills. He also states that he hasn't thought about how he would meet his family and his own priority needs without income management. Costas has also lost his BasicsCard a number of times and had to get a replacement. Based on this information, the delegate determines that Costas is financially vulnerable and does not grant him an exemption.</p>

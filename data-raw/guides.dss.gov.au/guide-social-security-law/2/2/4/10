<h2>Verifying Australian citizenship</h2>
<p>The concept of Australian citizenship was introduced on 26 January 1949 with the enactment of the <cite>Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948</cite>, which is now called the Australian Citizenship Act. Prior to this anyone born in Australia was considered to be a British subject. On 26 January 1949 people born in Australia automatically became citizens of Australia in most situations.</p>
<p>Generally a person born in Australia after the commencement of the <cite>Australian Citizenship Act 1948</cite> is an Australian citizen by birth. There are a number of ways of verifying that a person is an Australian citizen, depending on how and when the person became a citizen. A person could be an Australian citizen by:</p>
<ul><li>birth, or</li>
<li>descent, or</li>
<li>acquisition (naturalisation), or</li>
<li>adoption.</li>
</ul><h2>People born in Australia</h2>

</td>

<p>Where an adoption order is made under Australian law after the child arrives in Australia as a permanent resident, and at least one of the adoptive parents is an Australian citizen, the child will automatically acquire Australian citizenship. An application for Australian citizenship is not required, but parents may apply for a Certificate of Evidence of Australian Citizenship (also known as a declaratory certificate).</p>

<p>adopted overseas.</p>
</td>

<p>A permanent residence visa is granted to the child, which will appear in the child's foreign passport.</p>
<p>Where the adoptive parents have been resident overseas for at least 12 months at the time of the adoption and at least one parent is an Australian citizen, the adoptive child may be eligible for grant of Australian citizenship even if the adoption is not recognised under Australian law.</p>
<p>Where a full adoption occurs overseas, an application for the grant of Australian citizenship is required.</p>
<p>Where a state or territory welfare authority has arranged an adoption, Australian citizenship will not normally be granted until all the requirements have been completed and the adoption has been recognised under Australian law.</p>
<p>The requirements for Australian citizenship in this case are similar to the adoption visa requirements.</p>
<p>Following the grant of Australian citizenship, the adoptive child is eligible for an Australian passport. If Australian citizenship is granted prior to entry to Australia, an adoption visa is not required.</p>

<ul><li>To be eligible for visa subclass 102 (adoption), the adoption must have the approval of an Australian state or territory welfare authority.</li>
<li>If the child has been adopted under The Hague Convention or the Australia-China Agreement, the adoption is recognised under Australian law.</li>
</ul><p>There are some other, much less common, ways of acquiring Australian citizenship not described in the above tables. For persons who claim to be Australian citizens but do not fit into any of the above categories, <a href="../../../acronyms#dhs" title="Department of Human Services">DHS</a> staff are able to make enquiries that will often obtain proof of Australian citizenship. If DHS staff cannot obtain that proof they can suggest further avenues of enquiry available to the person themselves.</p>
<h2>Verifying a person is the holder of a permanent visa</h2>
<p>The most usual way of verifying that a person is the holder of a permanent visa is to sight evidence of the visa (i.e. a visa label) in the person's passport or obtain the information electronically direct from the Department of Home Affairs. Children may have been included on a parent's visa.</p>
<p>A person may have been granted a visa but not have evidence of the visa in their passport. In such cases, verification of the grant of the visa can be obtained from the Department of Home Affairs. Alternatively, Centrelink may accept an original letter from the Department of Home Affairs stating that the person has been granted permanent residence.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A visa is permission to travel to, enter and/or remain in Australia. This permission is granted by means of a decision made under the Migration Regulations. The visa label in a person's passport is simply evidence of that permission.</p>

<h2>Verifying a person is a protected SCV holder</h2>
<p>From 26 February 2001 new social security rules apply to SCV holders. See <a href="../../../3/1/1/10">3.1.1.10</a> Residence requirements for more information.</p>
<p>A person's status as a protected SCV holder can be verified by checking the date/s of arrival in Australia in the person's New Zealand passport or obtain the information electronically from the Department of Home Affairs.</p>
<p>All cases requiring assessment under any of the protected provisions are automatically referred to <a href="../../../acronyms#cis" title="Centrelink International Services">CIS</a> for verification and recording.</p>
<h2>Verifying a person is an SCV holder</h2>
<p>An SCV is granted to New Zealand citizens lawfully entering Australia using a New Zealand passport, if they do NOT hold a permanent visa. Grant of an SCV is evidenced by a 'port and date' stamp in the New Zealand passport. There will not usually be an adhesive visa label.</p>
<p>New Zealand citizens may apply for an SCV after arrival, through the Department of Home Affairs. This might happen where, for example, a New Zealand citizen has dual citizenship and arrives on the passport of the other country (most commonly the <a href="../../../acronyms#uk" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>). In these cases the person will receive an 'SCV holder' stamp in their New Zealand passport.</p>

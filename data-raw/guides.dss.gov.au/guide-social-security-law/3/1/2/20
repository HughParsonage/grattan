<li>whether they have dependent children (<a href="../../../1/1/d/70">1.1.D.70</a>).</li>
</ul><p>The rest of this topic explains the following about the LAWP:</p>
<ul><li>the payments it applies to</li>
<li>when it commences</li>
<li>the duration, and</li>
<li>how it is calculated.</li>

</tr></tbody></table><p>If a recipient is still working casually or part-time when they claim JSP, the delegate must decide when the recipient is deemed to be unemployed. This will usually be the date on which the last change to that employment occurred.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A change in the hours worked or a change from full-time to part-time.</p>
</div>
<p>The LAWP can be self-served in part or in full. Where a claim for an allowance is made after the LAWP would have expired, the recipient is deemed to have served a LAWP and the LAWP is completed. This self-served LAWP is considered a served and completed LAWP where the recipient makes another claim in a 12-month period, and therefore the recipient is not required to serve another LAWP.</p>
<p>The LAWP and any non-compliance deferment or rate reduction period resulting from a failure are served concurrently. Any period remaining at the expiry of the waiting period would still need to be served.</p>

<h2>Calculating the LAWP</h2>
<p>The LAWP is calculated differently depending on whether the recipient is single or a member of a couple or has a dependent child. This is explained in the following table:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">If the recipient is …</th>
<th scope="col">then the LAWP is calculated by …</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>a member of a couple, AND/OR has a dependent child</td>
<td>liquid assets minus the maximum reserve amount (see below), divided by $1,000.</td>
</tr><tr><td>NOT a member of a couple AND does NOT have a dependent child</td>
<td>liquid assets minus the maximum reserve amount (see below), divided by $500.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>From 1 July 2013 the maximum reserve amounts are:</p>
<ul><li>$10,000 for a recipient who is a member of a couple AND/OR has a dependent child, and</li>
<li>$5,000 for a recipient who is NOT a member of a couple AND does NOT have a dependent child.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the recipient is a member of a couple, the recipient's liquid assets includes those of their partner as per the definition of liquid assets provided in <a href="../../../1/1/l/50">1.1.L.50.</a></p>

<h2>Historical reserve amounts</h2>
<p>The following table shows the historical reserve amounts.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Date</th>
<th scope="col">Reserve amount</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01/02/1991 - 19/09/1997</td>
<td>The LAWP provisions commenced on 1 February 1991, through the <cite>Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1990</cite>. Initially, the LAWP was for a set duration of 4 weeks if the recipient's liquid assets exceeded the reserve amount. The reserve amounts were set at:
<ul><li>$10,000 for a member of a couple/carer of a dependent child, and</li>
<li>$5,000 for a single person.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>20/09/1997 - 01/04/2009</td>
<td>From 20 September 1997, the LAWP provisions were amended so that the length of the LAWP, in weeks, was calculated by dividing the amount by which the recipient's liquids assets exceeded the reserve amount by $1000 for a member of a couple/carer of a dependent child, or $500 for a single person.
<p>The maximum LAWP was limited to 13 weeks, and fractions of weeks were rounded down to the nearest whole week.</p>
<p>Also from 20 September 1997, the reserve amounts for the LAWP were reduced to:</p>
<ul><li>$5,000 for a member of a couple/carer of a dependent child, and</li>
<li>$2,500 for a single person.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>01/04/2009 - 31/03/2011</td>
<td>For the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011, the reserve amounts were temporarily doubled in response to the global recession. The maximum reserve amount between these dates was:
<ul><li>$10,000 for a recipient who is a member of a couple and/or has a dependent child, and</li>
<li>$5,000 for a recipient who is not a member of a couple and does not have a dependent child.</li>
</ul><p>Recipients who were already serving a LAWP on 1 April 2009 had their waiting period recalculated using the temporary maximum reserve amount. Recipients who began serving a LAWP on or before 31 March 2011 and continued to serve it after that date did not have their waiting period recalculated.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>01/04/2011 - 30/06/2013</td>
<td>For this period the reserve amounts returned to what they were prior to the temporary increase of 1 April 2009 of:
<ul><li>$5,000 for a member of a couple/carer of a dependent child, and</li>
<li>$2,500 for a single person.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr><td>01/07/2013 - current</td>
<td>From 1 July 2013, the reserve amounts were doubled to:
<ul><li>$10,000 for a member of a couple/carer of a dependent child, and</li>
<li>$5,000 for a single person.</li>

<h2>Waiving the LAWP</h2>
<p>The LAWP may be waived in full or in part when the recipient is in severe financial hardship as a result of unavoidable or reasonable expenditure (<a href="../../../1/1/u/20">1.1.U.20</a>). A recipient's reasonable cost of living does not have to be justified with receipts. The reasonable cost of living is an amount deemed by the delegate to be appropriate to the recipient's circumstances. The deemed amount cannot be exceeded. Reasonable costs of living cannot exceed the maximum rate of payment that the recipient would be entitled to.</p>

<h2>Temporary exemption from the LAWP - Coronavirus (COVID-19) 25 March 2020 to 24 September 2020</h2>
<p>As part of the response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the LAWP did not apply from 25 March 2020 to 24 September 2020 for the following payments, JSP, YA and Austudy. A person already serving a waiting period at 25 March 2020 was not required to serve the waiting period and was backdated to the date of claim.</p>
<p>At the end of the exemption period, recipients did not have any remaining waiting period to serve.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A LAWP did not resume for a person in receipt of JSP, YA, or Austudy at 24 September 2020.</p>
</div>
<p>At the end of the exemption period, the LAWP applies to NEW claimants from 25 September 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Note - intent to claim:</strong> The liquid assets test waiting period would not apply to a claim lodged on or after 25 September 2020 if the intent to claim provisions in section 13 of the SS(Admin)Act result in the claim day being backdated to a day before 25 September 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Note - early claim:</strong> A person who makes a claim before 25 September 2020 but only qualifies for payment after 25 September 2020, will need to serve a LAWP (unless they are otherwise exempt or have already self-served the waiting period). This is because clause 4 of Schedule 2 to the SS(Admin)Act provides that the person's claim is taken to be made on the first day on which the person is qualified for the social security payment.</p>

<h2>Working credit</h2>
<p>A recipient serving a LAWP is not receiving a payment, so can only become eligible to accrue or deplete working credit after the waiting period has been served.</p>
<p>A LAWP is ignored when calculating the length of a break in payment for carrying over working credit balances. That is, the break in payment is measured to the date of grant, and not to the end of the LAWP. The carried over working credit balance becomes the recipient's opening balance on the day they start to receive their income support payment.</p>

<h1 >3.1.13.90 Reasonable Excuse</h1>
<h2>General principles</h2>
<p>The legislation requires that, before <a href="../../../acronyms#dhs" title="Department of Human Services">DHS</a> imposes any penalty, the decision maker must establish whether the job seeker had a reasonable excuse for failing to meet their requirements.</p>
<p>However, if:</p>
<ul><li>the job seeker had a reasonable excuse on the day for failing to attend an appointment or activity,</li>
<li>it was reasonable to expect the job seeker to have given prior notice of the reasonable excuse to the organisation which arranged the appointment or activity, and</li>
<li>the job seeker failed to do so,</li>
</ul><p>then the job seeker cannot be taken to have had a reasonable excuse.</p>
<h2>Circumstances in which a job seeker cannot be expected to give prior notice of a reasonable excuse</h2>
<p>The legislation provides that a reasonable excuse can only be considered a reasonable excuse if the job seeker gives prior notice of it. However, the legislation also provides that this does not apply if the decision maker is satisfied that, in the circumstances, it would not have been reasonable to expect a job seeker to give such prior notice. This provision gives decision makers the discretion to waive a job seeker's requirement to give prior notice of non-attendance in any circumstance where they believe it was unreasonable to expect the job seeker to have done so.</p>
<p>The following are examples of some circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to expect the job seeker to have given advance notice of their inability to attend:</p>
<ul><li>The job seeker or an immediate or close family member suffered a sudden serious illness or was hospitalised.</li>
<li>The job seeker lacked access to any means of contacting the provider (e.g. the job seeker had no mobile phone credit and no reasonable access to any other means of contacting the provider, such as a friend's phone or a public phone).</li>
<li>The job seeker was not made aware of the requirement to give advance notice.</li>
</ul><p>It is important to note that, even though a job seeker may have been physically able to give advance notice, it may still not have been reasonable to expect them to have done so. For example, a parent whose child is seriously ill may have access to a phone but it may still be unreasonable to expect them to think of calling their provider or DHS as relevant.</p>
<p>Even if the job seeker's reason for not attending an appointment or an activity was that they were engaged in another activity at the time which meant that they were fully meeting their requirements (e.g. working) or for which they would normally have been exempt from requirements (e.g. illness), their reason should not necessarily be taken to provide a reasonable excuse for their failure. The circumstances need to be considered on a case by case basis, with the crucial consideration being whether, regardless of the reason for missing the appointment or activity, the job seeker could reasonably have been expected to give prior notice that they would be unable to attend.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00580" title="Social Security (Administration) Act 1999">SS(Admin)Act</a> section 42UA Prior notification of excuse</p>
</div>
<h2>Meaning of reasonable excuse</h2>
<p>Assuming that the job seeker gave prior notice when it was reasonable to expect them to have done so, the following considerations may lead the delegate to decide that the job seeker has a reasonable excuse and therefore that no failure should be applied.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term reasonable excuse is discretionary but the excuse must be one that an ordinary member of the community would accept as reasonable in the circumstances. Mutual obligation requirements are designed to prepare job seekers for work and therefore a reasonable excuse should also be one that an employer would consider reasonable for an employee who missed work. The job seeker is also required to give prior notice of their inability to attend when it is reasonable to do so, as an employee is expected to.</p>
<p>The failure must not simply be a deliberate act of non-compliance. If the circumstance that prevented the job seeker from meeting their requirement was unforeseeable or outside the person's control, it provides a reasonable excuse. However, this does not necessarily mean that a circumstance that was foreseeable or was within the job seeker's control does not constitute a reasonable excuse.</p>
<p>It is also important to establish that the requirement that the job seeker was supposed to undertake was reasonable, was within their capacity and that the job seeker was notified correctly. If a requirement was not within a job seeker's capacity, they have a reasonable excuse for not meeting it. It should also be remembered that, because a job seeker's circumstances can change, a requirement that was reasonable at the time a job seeker entered into their Job Plan may no longer be reasonable at the time they failed to comply.</p>
<p>When determining if a recipient has a reasonable excuse for failing to meet a requirement, DHS must consider the recipient's personal circumstances. For example, a history of homelessness or an episodic mental illness could have been a factor in the recipient's failure to comply. Administrative tools such as the Vulnerability Indicator (placed on a job seeker's computer record) can be useful in alerting delegates to personal circumstances that could potentially explain a job seeker's non-compliance. The delegate should also be alert for any undisclosed personal issues, particularly mental health issues that could have explained the failure. It will not always be the case that, in a particular instance, such issues were a factor, but DHS must consider this possibility carefully in every case where such issues are evident.</p>
<h2>Specific factors to consider</h2>
<p>The factors that, as a minimum, the decision maker must take into account are listed in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2009L01803">Social Security (Reasonable Excuse - Participation Payment Obligations) (DEEWR) Determination 2009 (No. 1).</a> These are:</p>
<ul><li>that the person did not have access to safe, secure and adequate housing, or was using emergency accommodation or a refuge, at the time of the failure,</li>
<li>the literacy and language skills of the person,</li>
<li>an illness, impairment or condition of the person that requires treatment, including an illness that is episodic or unpredictable in nature,</li>
<li>a cognitive or neurological impairment of the person,</li>
<li>a psychiatric or psychological impairment or mental illness of the person,</li>
<li>a drug or alcohol dependency of the person,</li>
<li>unforeseen family or caring responsibilities of the person,</li>
<li>that the person was subjected to criminal violence,</li>
<li>that the person was subjected to family violence,</li>
<li>that the person was subjected to sexual assault,</li>
<li>that the person was adversely affected by the death of an immediate family member or close relative,</li>
<li>recent release from prison, where the job seeker has spent more than 14 days in prison within the past 28 days.</li>
</ul><p>However, the above list is not exhaustive. When considering reasonable excuse, the decision maker should take into account all factors that may have affected the job seeker's ability to comply. Additional factors to consider could include:</p>
<ul><li>illness of the job seeker's child or someone for whom they have caring responsibilities,</li>
<li>disabilities the person may have (including any requirements as a direct result of the disability such as the need for a carer or personal assistant),</li>
<li>if the person was working at the time they were expected to meet their requirement,</li>
<li>if the person had a job interview at the time they were expected to meet their requirement,</li>
<li>lack of availability and affordability of transport,</li>
<li>lack of availability of child care, and</li>
<li>lack of awareness of the requirement (e.g. through non-receipt of correspondence).</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the decision maker can interpret any factor included in the above list more broadly if the circumstances of the case warrant it. For example, although an immediate family member generally means a person's partner, father, mother, sister, brother or child, in some cases, it could include any person the decision maker believes should be treated as though they were an immediate family member, such as a member of the job seeker's adoptive or foster family (whether or not the fostering arrangement was formal).</p>
<p>On the other hand, any of the above factors may provide a reasonable excuse only if it had a significant effect on the job seeker's capacity to comply with the specific requirement at the time the job seeker failed to comply and the job seeker had given prior notice of the reasonable excuse to the organisation which arranged the appointment or activity if it was reasonable to do so.</p>
<h2>Non-receipt of mail</h2>
<p>The <cite>Acts Interpretation Act 1901</cite> states that a letter correctly addressed and posted is deemed to have been given to the job seeker at the time at which it would normally be delivered by post. However, deemed delivery does not necessarily mean that the job seeker received the letter and the Acts Interpretation Act provisions do not override the reasonable excuse provisions of the SSAct.</p>
<p>Where the job seeker advises that they have not received the notification, the decision maker needs to assess the reasonable excuse before making a decision to apply a failure.</p>
<p>This should include consideration of all of the following:</p>
<ul><li>previous attendance and compliance history,</li>
<li>the explanation of the job seeker,</li>
<li>whether other documented contact attempts such as SMS messages, phone calls and face-to-face reminders were made,</li>
<li>whether a recent change of address may have meant that the job seeker did not receive the notification,</li>
<li>the job seeker's accommodation circumstances and possible diversions of mail, and</li>
<li>whether the job seeker has a history of mail disturbances and what steps they have taken to secure their mail.</li>
</ul><h2>Medical evidence</h2>
<p>If a person claims to have been sick and unable to attend a particular activity or appointment then it is preferable that a medical certificate verify the person's illness. However, in some circumstances it will be unreasonable to ask for one. It is common that a short illness such as a cold or virus may not require a visit to the doctor. In many cases, it may be obvious from talking to the person that this is the situation. If a person is ill and advises their employment services provider ahead of the requirement time, the provider can reschedule the requirement and should not report the failure (unless the provider has reason to doubt the genuineness of the illness). However, the delegate should not accept without question the excuse of illness if the person has a history of missing requirements due to minor unverified illnesses without advising their employment services provider ahead of time.</p>

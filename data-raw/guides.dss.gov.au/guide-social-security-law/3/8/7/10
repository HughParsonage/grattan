</ul><h2>Who may be paid TAL</h2>
<p>To be paid TAL, a person must be a telephone subscriber on the relevant test day.</p>
<p>A telephone subscriber is a person who has a telephone line or mobile phone service connected in either their, or their partner's name. Note that the definition of telephone subscriber can also include a person who is the subscriber to a mobile phone service in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> TAL test days are 1 January, 20 March, 1 July and 20 September each year. Qualification and payability provisions are applied to recipients on each TAL test day and if met, TAL will be paid on the recipient's payment delivery day on or after the TAL test day.</p>
<p>No TAL is payable if the person is ineligible for TAL on those days.</p>
<p>The following table sets out who may be paid TAL, the criteria that must be met and relevant references.</p>

</div>
<h2>Notifiable events for TAL</h2>
<p>In addition to the common notifiable events (<a href="../../1/3">3.1.3</a>), TAL recipients must notify Centrelink, within the 14-day notification period, if any of the following events occur, or are likely to occur:</p>
<ul><li>they or their partner stop being qualified for a payment for which they receive TAL, or</li>
<li>they are a member of a couple (<a href="../../../1/1/m/120">1.1.M.120</a>) and their partner (<a href="../../../1/1/p/85">1.1.P.85</a>) dies, or</li>
<li>they stop being a telephone subscriber, (<a href="../../../1/1/t/40">1.1.T.40</a>), or</li>
<li>they stop subscribing to a home internet connection. (This impacts on the payment of the higher rate of TAL.)</li>
</ul><h2>Rates of TAL</h2>
<p>There are 2 rates of TAL - a standard rate and a higher rate.</p>
<p>From 20 September 2009, the higher rate of TAL is only payable to recipients of DSP who are under 21 without dependent children, and only if they or their partner have a home internet connection or a specified mobile phone internet service.</p>
<p>The standard rate applies to all other eligible recipients.</p>

<h2>TAL rates for members of a couple (<a href="../../../1/1/m/120">1.1.M.120</a>)</h2>
<p>If a person is a member of a couple, the TAL rate is determined by considering the eligibility of both partners, irrespective of which is the telephone subscriber. The rate at which TAL is paid depends upon whether the person's partner is in receipt of a pension, benefit or allowance, as explained in the table in SSAct section <span class="nobr">1061S(1)</span>. The TAL payment CANNOT be calculated using the circumstances of just one partner, even by request.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person who is a member of a couple receives JSP and meets all other criteria for the payment of the standard rate of TAL. Their partner receives transitional rate pension and does not receive TAL as the value of TAL has been incorporated into their pension rate. The person will receive the partnered rate of TAL in accordance with SSAct section 1061S Item 5.</p>
</div>
<p>If a person is a member of an illness separated, respite care or temporarily separated couple, they CAN qualify individually for TAL.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Each partner is treated as an individual. They CANNOT qualify for a combined TAL rate because they are NOT living together.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A person qualifies for TAL. Their partner is in approved respite care. The couple are living apart and therefore MUST be assessed individually.</p>

<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../../../5/1/7/60">5.1.7.60</a> TAL - current rates</p>
</div>
<h2>Home internet connection</h2>
<p>The following is an example of a home internet connection which attracts the increased rate of TAL:</p>
<ul><li>Broadband internet service (NBN (National Broadband Network), cable, ADSL or satellite) delivered to the person's home, including where the internet service is part of a service 'bundle' (e.g. Transact, Telstra, Optus).</li>
</ul><p>The following are examples of home internet connections which DO NOT attract the higher rate of TAL:</p>
<ul><li>Where a person subscribes (pays for) an internet service but the service is not delivered to the person's home.</li>
<li>Where a person's home internet connection is provided by their employer as part of a remuneration package.</li>
<li>A mobile phone that is internet enabled but is not used (e.g. a mobile phone is internet enabled but the person has not purchased an internet service for the phone).</li>
<li>Pre-paid internet of any quantity or duration.</li>
</ul><h2>Internet via mobile phone</h2>
<p>The following are examples of internet via mobile phone which DO attract the higher rate of TAL:</p>
<ul><li>Broadband internet service delivered through a mobile phone where the internet service is part of a bundle.</li>
<li>A mobile phone plan for which a specific amount is paid to cover the cost of an internet connection, provided the account is not on a pre-paid temporary basis.</li>
</ul><p>The following are examples of internet via mobile phone which DO NOT attract the higher rate of TAL:</p>
<ul><li>A mobile that is internet enabled but is not used (e.g. a mobile phone is internet enabled but the person has not purchased an internet service for the phone).</li>
<li>A mobile phone is internet enabled but a person pays for individual calls and does not pay an ongoing subscription for internet access.</li>
<li>A mobile phone plan with internet access through the phone provider's web browser and does not require an additional premium for internet access via an internet service provider of the person's choice or the cost of the internet access component cannot be identified.</li>
</ul><h2>TAL during an employment income nil rate period</h2>
<p>During an employment income nil rate period, a person is considered qualified for TAL because during that period they are taken to be receiving (<a href="../../../1/1/r/55">1.1.R.55</a>) their social security pension or benefit for the purposes of TAL.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Julie, who is under age pension age, is getting PPS and is a telephone subscriber. She starts a casual job as a florist and her income is above the cut-out point, so PPS is no longer payable. Julie is qualified for an employment income nil rate period. As Julie is still a telephone subscriber, she will remain eligible for TAL during the employment income nil rate period. Julie also satisfies the payability conditions to receive TAL.</p>

<p>If a person has a working credit balance when they commence employment, their 6 or 12 month extension of TAL starts from the exhaustion of their working credit balance (not from the commencement of employment).</p>

</div>
<h2>TAL during an 8-week non-payment period due to a serious participation failure or multiple participation failures</h2>
<p>A person who is otherwise qualified for TAL cannot receive it where the payday falls during an 8-week non-payment period due to a serious participation failure or multiple participation failures. During that period they are NOT considered to be receiving income support for the purposes of TAL.</p>
<h2>Income &amp; assets testing</h2>
<p>TAL is NOT income or assets tested separately from the person's main income support payment.</p>
<h2>Overpayment of TAL</h2>
<p>TAL overpayments resulting from a recipient not notifying Centrelink that they are no longer a telephone subscriber are normally waived because the amount is generally below the overpayment recovery limit.</p>
<p>A delegate should add the amount of overpaid TAL to other overpayments if:</p>
<ul><li>a person's circumstances change, and</li>
<li>the change means they no longer qualify for a social security payment, or</li>
<li>the change means that TAL is no longer payable to the person.</li>

<h1 >3.4.7.130 Sample PBS Top Up Calculations</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There are 3 steps involved in working out a top up:</p>
<ul><li>determining that there is a qualifying event for a top up, and</li>
<li>determining the highest rate of pension to use when calculating the top up, and</li>
<li>working out the difference between the amount of pension bonus originally paid and the amount payable using the highest rate of pension.</li>
</ul><p>A qualifying event occurs when pension has increased within the 13 week top up period, because of a reduction in income/assets.</p>
<p>The highest rate of pension is the highest pension rate paid in the top up period that is at least partially because of a reduction in the assessed income/assets.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pension calculation rates in the examples below represent <a href="../../../acronyms#mbr" title="Maximum basic rate">MBR</a> plus the pension supplement component for pension bonus (PSCPB). Fictitious rates are used where indexation is mentioned.</p>

<h2>Top up calculations where changes in couple status occurs during the accrual period for pension bonus</h2>
<p>If there was a change in couple status over the pension bonus accrual period, SSAct section 93J(2) would have been used to calculate the original PBS payment. This uses a notional calculated rate that is based on a percentage of the maximum annual calculated rate.</p>
<p>The same principle is applied for top ups for these cases. The highest calculated rate of pension in the 13 weeks from the PBS start day will also be a percentage of the maximum annual rate.</p>
<p>Round percentages to 3 decimal places. The percentage of maximum rate payable at the qualifying event must be HIGHER than the percentage of maximum rate on the PBS start day in order for any amount of top up to be payable.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Samantha accrues a bonus for 5 years - 3 years as a single person and 2 years as a partnered person. She is partnered when she claims PBS. Her original bonus is calculated using 80% of the maximum annual rate to a partnered person. Later, she has a qualifying event for a top up. Her highest calculated rate in the 13 weeks since the PBS start day is equivalent to 85% of the maximum annual rate. Apply 85% to the PBS calculation instead of 80% to determine the top up amount.</p>
</div>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 93J(2) Change in couple status during overall qualifying period</p>
</div>
<h2>Qualifying event for top ups - members of a couple who separate within 13 weeks of the PBS start day</h2>
<p>In some cases, a person will be paid a pension bonus and change couple status within 13 weeks from when the pension bonus was paid. A manual calculation of the top up amount may be required.</p>
<p>Some members of a couple will have a qualifying event for a top up based on a rate determination due to reduction in income/assets prior to their separation. If there has been no reduction in income/assets and corresponding increase in partnered rate before a couple separates, check for changes after the separation.</p>
<p>In order to check for this, the person's personal income/assets after separation should be compared with their share of the combined income/assets, prior to separation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If Alan has $200 in earnings and Daniel has $50 in earnings, their combined income is $250 and their share of the combined income is 50%, so $125 each. (Their personal income is $200 and $50 respectively).</p>
</div>
<p>When members of a couple separate and there is no difference between their share of combined income/assets and their new personal income/assets at the time of separation, a qualifying event has NOT occurred.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a couple holds $200,000 in combined assets, and when they separate they hold $100,000 in personal assets each, then there has been no change in assets. This does not constitute in itself, a qualifying event for a top up. A qualifying event may occur at a later stage if income/assets reduce and the person's single pension rate increases.</p>
</div>
<p>If there is a determination being made to change a person's couple status and to change their income/assets and these take effect from the same day, then the percentage of maximum rate becomes important when working out the 'highest rate of pension' paid in the 13 week top up period.</p>
<p>In the case where:</p>
<ul><li>a determination is made that a person's personal income and/or assets at separation are less than their share of combined income/assets before separation, AND</li>
<li>the determination that changes the person's couple status has the same date of effect as the income/assets determination, AND</li>
<li>these combined changes result in an increase in the person's calculated rate,</li>
</ul><p>then the PERCENTAGE OF MAXIMUM CALCULATED RATE on the start day and after the determinations should be compared. (Round the percentage to 3 decimal points.)</p>
<p>This is necessary because it is possible that the calculated rate may only have increased because of the change from partnered to single rate, i.e. the reduction in income/assets alone, may not have been enough to cause an increase in rate.</p>
<p>If the percentage of maximum calculated rate decreases or stays the same, then no top up is payable.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> John's calculated rate is 50% of the maximum calculated partnered rate and his bonus is calculated on this amount. John separates from his partner, his calculated rate increases and he is now receiving 48% of the maximum single rate. Because the percentage of calculated rate has not increased, no top up is payable.</p>

<h2>Top ups - single at start day, partnered within 13 weeks</h2>
<p>A significant change in income/assets may result in a person receiving a top up even though they have been changed from single to partnered rate since the PBS start day.</p>
<p>The same basic rules that apply to separations occur to partnering or re-partnering as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Determine if a qualifying event has occurred. If a change in couple status occurs at a different time to the change in income/assets, then compare personal income and assets before the person became a member of a couple with their share of combined income/assets after they became partnered to ensure a reduction has occurred. Also ensure that the calculated rate increased when the income/assets changed.</li>
<li>If the determination to change the person's couple status has the same date of effect as the rate determination that reduced the assessed income/assets, compare the percentage of maximum calculated rate of partnered pension with the percentage of maximum calculated single rate.</li>
<li>The top up is based using the highest calculated pension rate (or highest percentage of maximum rate) paid in the 13 weeks that resulted from the reduction is assessed income/assets.</li>

<h1 >3.4.10.20 Qualifying Sugarcane Farmers &amp; RASF</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> THIS SCHEME CLOSED on 12 July 2007 and the following INFORMATION is FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There are a few ways in which an applicant can satisfy the qualifying sugarcane farmer provisions:</p>
<ul><li>have owned their current farm property for 15 years, or</li>
<li>have been actively involved in farming in Australia for any period/s totalling 20 years, or</li>
<li>be the widow or former partner of a qualifying farmer.</li>
</ul><p>This topic explains these points, and the issue of significant labour and income.</p>
<h2>Qualifying sugarcane farmers (<a href="../../../1/1/q/50">1.1.Q.50</a>) - 15 years ownership</h2>
<p>As well as outright ownership for a period of 15 years, a person is considered to have owned a farm (<a href="../../../1/1/f/100">1.1.F.100</a>) property in Australia for that time if they had initially owned only a PART of the currently existing farm enterprise (<a href="../../../1/1/f/110">1.1.F.110</a>).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A farmer, who owned a parcel of land 15 years ago and has subsequently acquired adjoining parcels of land that currently make-up the farm enterprise.</p>
</div>
<p>The 15 years ownership period MUST have been continuous. If the person has bought and sold a series of farms, and there were any periods during which they did not hold a qualifying interest in a farm, they will NOT satisfy the test and will need to qualify on the basis of 20 years in farming.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Documents such as title deeds should be obtained for the previously owned farms, to verify there are not gaps in ownership. In these situations, it may be easier for the person to meet the 20 years involvement test.</p>
</div>
<p>In normal circumstances, a farmer must have contributed at least 50% of his or her labour and capital to farming and derived at least 50% of his or her income from farming.</p>
<p>The farm must have been a sugarcane farm (<a href="../../../1/1/s/405">1.1.S.405</a>) for at least 2 years and at all times since 29 April 2004. During the 2 years prior to transfer, the farmer's labour and capital must have been in the development of a sugarcane farm and they have derived a significant part of their income from sugarcane.</p>
<h2>Qualifying sugarcane farmers - 20 years involvement</h2>
<p>To meet the 20 years involvement test, any 20 years of the applicant's working life can be taken into account, provided they were in Australia at the time. The 20 years does NOT need to be continuous.</p>
<p>Farm managers who acquired ownership of a farm before 29 April 2004 are qualifying sugarcane farmers if they can establish:</p>
<ul><li>their involvement in farming for 20 years (50% of their labour must have been contributed to farming and 50% of their income derived from farming),</li>
<li>during the last 2 years the time spent farming sugarcane must have exceeded 50% of their total labour, and</li>
<li>during the last 2 years the income earned from sugarcane farming must have exceeded 50% of the total income.</li>
</ul><h2>Qualifying sugarcane farmers - widows &amp; other former partners of farmers</h2>
<p>Eligible former partners (<a href="../../../1/1/e/72">1.1.E.72</a>) of qualifying sugarcane farmers may also access <a href="../../../acronyms#rasf" title="Retirement assistance for sugarcane farmers scheme">RASF</a> if they have an eligible interest (<a href="../../../1/1/e/75">1.1.E.75</a>) in the sugarcane farm. This applies even though they do not actually meet the definition of a qualifying sugarcane farmer themselves.</p>
<p>If the person has again become a member of a couple (<a href="../../../1/1/m/120">1.1.M.120</a>) since the death or separation from a farmer partner, they will NOT meet the definition of an eligible former partner.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A divorced couple who continue to own their sugarcane farm jointly. The property is still farmed by one partner, but the other has moved off the farm and derives most of their income from employment in town. As the former partner does not work or earn any income from the property, they will not be a qualifying farmer, but if they have not become a member of another couple, they may be an eligible former partner of a qualifying farmer.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A woman inherited the farm when her husband died in 1995. She has never worked on the farm but her husband had farmed it since 1955 and would have been a qualifying farmer at the time of his death. She has a qualifying interest as she is the legal owner of the sugarcane farm.</p>
</div>
<p>A widowed person will often meet the definition of a qualifying sugarcane farmer, in which case there is no need for them to establish that they are an eligible former partner.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Example: A woman who had worked on her husband's farm since 1960 became the owner of the property when he died in 2000. Although she has not owned the farm for more than 15 years, she is the legal owner, and has worked on the property for more than 20 years.</p>
</div>
<p>To qualify for RASF, the former partner must meet ALL the other eligibility criteria in their own right.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The farmers' income test.</p>
</div>
<h2>Contributed significant labour &amp; derived significant income</h2>
<p>Generally a person would satisfy the significant labour, capital and income provision if, over the 15 or 20 year period, they:</p>
<ul><li>have spent at least half of their working hours on the farm, AND</li>
<li>derived at least half their income from the farm.</li>
</ul><p>As this provision is not defined in the Act, each case should be treated individually.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A sugarcane farmer purchased his farm in 1989 and planted sugarcane. From 2000 to 2002, the farmer worked full-time in off-farm employment, but continued to work on the farm after hours, and continued to receive a small income from his sugarcane farm. For the period 2002 till 2005, all of his labour was contributed to the sugarcane farm. The farmer retired in 2005 and gifted the farm to his daughter. The farmer is a qualifying sugarcane farmer because:</p>
<ul><li>he has continuously owned a farm for at least 15 years, and</li>
<li>during the period of ownership, the significant part of his income, labour and capital was related to the farm, and</li>
<li>contribution of his labour and capital and the income he derived was from a sugarcane farm for at least the last 2 years.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Due to a downturn in the sugar industry, a sugarcane farmer has undertaken employment on a nearby cattle farm so that less than 50% of his time has been spent working on the sugarcane farm and less than 50% of his income has been earned on the sugarcane farm. If the farmer could demonstrate that normally he would meet the definition of a qualifying sugarcane farmer (i.e. that normally over 50% if his or her time was spent farming sugarcane and over 50% of his or her income would be earned from the sugarcane farm), then he or she would qualify. However, if the majority of their contributed labour and income derivation was from something other than farming for a period of time exceeding one year then he or she would NOT qualify.</p>
</div>
<p>Gross income figures should be used when determining whether a person has derived a significant part of their income from farming, i.e. income before expenses.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In cases where the net farm income is nil or a loss, genuine farmers would be disadvantaged if the net figures were used.</p>
</div>
<h2>Investors</h2>
<p>An investor will not be able to demonstrate a significant contribution of their labour to the farm enterprise or derivation of significant income from the enterprise, and therefore cannot be a qualifying farmer.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Investors will often have a primary occupation and/or source of income to which they devote their time and effort.</p>

</div>
<h2>DSP recipients subject to participation requirements</h2>
<p>From 1 July 2014, DSP recipients who have compulsory participation requirements and are not exempt will have their DSP suspended or cancelled if they do not:</p>
<ul><li>attend any participation interview (including the initial interview) or appointment with an employment service provider, or other (e.g. rehabilitation) provider</li>
<li>sign a participation plan (including a Job Plan) which includes a compulsory activity, or</li>
<li>undertake a compulsory activity.</li>
</ul><p>If the DSP recipient does not comply with their compulsory participation requirements they will have their DSP suspended on the first occasion until they do comply. The policy will allow for DSP recipients to be restored without loss of payment on the first occasion, of non-compliance (up to a period of 13 weeks).</p>
<p>On the second occasion of non-compliance within a 12 month period from the date of first suspension, the DSP recipient will again have their DSP suspended. Payment can be restored if the DSP recipient re-engages and there is evidence of their participation. DSP will not be payable for the period of suspension unless it is determined that the recipients did not fail to comply (see below).</p>
<p>DSP recipients who do not comply with any of their participation requirements for a third time within the 12 month timeframe (from the date of first suspension), will have their DSP cancelled. They will have to reapply for DSP and be reassessed against the current Impairment Tables to determine their eligibility.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances it may be determined that a DSP recipient has not failed to comply. These circumstances are outlined in <a href="130">3.6.1.130</a>.</p>
<p>DSP recipients with participation requirements will receive notification of the effect of non-compliance on their payment to encourage them to re-engage before their payment is suspended or cancelled.</p>

<h2>Medical qualification updates</h2>
<p>If a person's DSP is cancelled as a result of the medical qualification update because the person no longer meets the impairment and/or CITW requirements, the date of effect of the cancellation decision is 42 days from the date of notification of cancellation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Payment of DSP will continue for 42 days after the person has been notified of the cancellation decision. This allows the person to re-arrange their affairs and apply for an alternative income support payment. In addition, if the person appeals, a delegate can authorise continuation of DSP pending the outcome of the appeal. The 42-day period of payment allows for this to happen without delays in, or breaks in continuity of, payment.</p>

<h2>Continuation of DSP while working - increase to the allowable hours of work</h2>
<p>A person who is receiving DSP may continue to be qualified for DSP if they obtain paid work of 15 hours a week and less than 30 hours a week. People who are working will continue to be subject to existing means test rules.</p>
<p>This does not change the definition of 'work' for the purpose of assessing a person's CITW for new claims for DSP, i.e. to qualify for DSP a person must have an inability to work 15 hours a week.</p>
<p>The 'continuation of DSP while working' rule applies to a person who has qualified for DSP under the existing qualification criteria (including the CITW) and, subsequently takes up work or increases their hours of work while receiving the DSP.</p>
<p>Suspension rules may apply if the recipient works for 30 hours a week or more.</p>
<p>The intent of this rule is to allow people to test their ability to take on more work while maintaining the safety net of the DSP payments.</p>

<h2>Transitional arrangements - people suspended for working 15 hours or more, but less than 30 hours at 01/07/2012</h2>
<p>A person who has their DSP suspended immediately before 1 July 2012 because they obtained paid work that was for at least 15 hours per week and less than 30 hours per week will have their suspension reconsidered in light of the above.</p>
<h2>Commencing work on a long term basis</h2>
<p>The return to work suspension provisions apply to DSP recipients who commence work or increase their income from work on a long term basis. The suspension provisions do not apply to those who are ordinarily unable to maintain such work on a long term basis.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Jonah may be able to work 30 hours a week, with effort in the short term - such as working as a Santa over December. However, Jonah is only able to maintain the extra effort for this short period. Jonah's DSP will not be suspended but will be assessed under the income and assets tests, or may be subject to an employment income nil rate period (<a href="../../1/12">3.1.12</a>).</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview of return to work - suspension provisions</h2>
<p>A person's DSP payment may be suspended rather than cancelled for up to 2 years if the recipient notified that they have started work of 30 hours or more (at or above the relevant minimum wage) on a long term basis.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The suspension provision is not available to a person whose DSP is cancelled, due to obtaining work, before the person notifies that he or she has obtained work.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00580" title="Social Security (Administration) Act 1999">SS(Admin)Act</a> section 97A DSP-suspension instead of cancellation under section 94 (person obtains work), section 97B DSP-suspension instead of cancellation under section 94 (person's income), section 94 Automatic cancellation-recipient not complying with subsection 68(2) notice</p>
</div>
<h2>Return to work suspension &amp; notification provisions</h2>
<p>If a DSP recipient notifies that they have started work of 30 hours a week or more on a long term basis, their DSP payment MUST be suspended immediately, or after their working credit balance has reduced to nil. In this event, DSP can remain suspended for up to 2 years. If the recipient has a partner receiving either CP, the partner's payment may also be suspended for the same period where applicable.</p>
<p>Payments for the DSP recipient and their partner can be suspended regardless of whether the notification is within the notification period of 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the DSP recipient's payment is cancelled outside of the notification period (for starting work of 30 hours a week or more), before the recipient has notified of the change in their circumstances, payment cannot be suspended or deemed to be suspended and must be cancelled from the day that work commenced.</p>
<h2>Partner payments</h2>
<p>If the DSP recipient has a partner receiving either CP in respect of the DSP recipient, the payment of that benefit is also suspended (or deemed suspended) rather than cancelled where applicable.</p>
<p>CP is only suspended (or deemed suspended) rather than cancelled where qualification for CP is lost due to the DSP recipient's work. If however the CP partner provides the amount of care to remain eligible for CP during the DSP suspension (or deemed suspension), then CP may be retained rather than suspended (or deemed suspended).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Qualification for CP is affected by the amount of care provided by the CP partner. The employment of the DSP recipient may impact on CP qualification and should be reviewed.</p>
</div>
<p>If the DSP recipient's partner receives CP in respect of a care receiver who is not the DSP recipient, the suspension (or deemed suspension) rules do not apply to the CP partner. CP may, however, be impacted by the income of the DSP partner.</p>
<h2>Multiple entitlement arrangements</h2>
<p>During the suspension (or deemed suspension) period, a DSP recipient can receive another income support payment such as <a href="../../../acronyms#jsp" title="Jobseeker payment">JSP</a>, subject to meeting eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>If the DSP recipient has a partner receiving CP and the partner's payment is also suspended (or deemed suspended), the CP partner can receive another income support payment as long as they are eligible for that payment in their own right during the suspension (or deemed suspension) period.</p>
<h2>Working credit</h2>
<p>If the DSP recipient has a working credit balance and starts work at 30 hours or more a week where wages are at or above the relevant minimum wage on a long term basis, the recipient is treated as being qualified until their working credit balance reduces to nil. As a result, the 2 year suspension (or deemed suspension) commences from the day their working credit balance reduces to nil.</p>
<h2>Length of the suspension</h2>
<p>Two years is the maximum amount of time that payment can be suspended (or for deemed suspension a maximum of 2 years and 14 days). After this time, the DSP recipient's payment must be cancelled.</p>
<p>If a recipient notifies of commencing work on the last day of the 14 day notification period, payment is suspended for up to 2 years from this date.</p>
<p>If the recipient has working credits, the 2 year period commences once the working credit balance has reduced to nil.</p>
<p>If a recipient does not notify within the 14 day notification period, the suspension period starts on the day the recipient commenced work, or if the person has working credits, it will commence when the working credit balance is reduced to nil.</p>

<h2>Work bonus for employed or self-employed DSP recipients of age pension age</h2>
<p>A work bonus may be used to reduce the amount of income assessed in an instalment period. Pensioners over age pension age (apart from PPS) may be eligible for the work bonus. Employment income, and self-employment income from gainful work, is eligible for the work bonus from 1 July 2019. Prior to 1 July 2019, only employment income was eligible for the work bonus.</p>
<p>Work bonus applies only to DSP recipients who are:</p>

<h2><a href="../../../acronyms#pcc" title="Pensioner concession card">PCC</a> extension</h2>
<p>For the first 12 months after returning to work, the recipient retains qualification for a PCC. This applies even if the recipient fails to notify of the commencement of that work within 14 days and applies where DSP is suspended or reduced to a zero rate because of income from employment.</p>
<p>If the recipient's partner was receiving CP, they retain qualification for a PCC for 12 weeks.</p>
<h2>Start date of PCC extension</h2>
<p>If a recipient has working credits and qualifies for a 12 month PCC extension, the 12 months starts from the day the recipient's working credit balance reduces to nil (not from the commencement of employment or increase in employment income).</p>

<h2><a href="../../../acronyms#tal" title="Telephone allowance">TAL</a> extension</h2>
<p>For recipients of DSP aged under 21 without children, qualification for TAL may be extended for 12 months following cancellation of DSP.</p>
<p>For the first 12 months after returning to work, the DSP recipient retains qualification for TAL. This applies even if the recipient notifies of the commencement of that work after the 14 day notification period.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20 September 2009 TAL is not available to pensioners receiving common pension rates (<a href="../../../5/1/8/10">5.1.8.10</a>) and TAL is not payable for the extension period to any person who received a transitional rate (<a href="../../../5/1/8/40">5.1.8.40</a>) of DSP or a notional rate of pension supplement (<a href="../../../1/2/10/10">1.2.10.10</a>) that included the pension supplement minimum amount, immediately before the cessation of their DSP.</p>
<p>If the DSP recipient's partner was receiving JSP or CP, the partner retains qualification for TAL for 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20 September 2009, the 6 months extension of TAL is not payable to any JSP or CP recipient if, immediately before the cessation of their payment, they were receiving either a transitional rate of pension or a notional rate of pension supplement that included the pension supplement minimum amount.</p>

<h2>Restoration of DSP</h2>
<p>Payment of DSP can be restored if the recipient does one of the following within the suspension period:</p>
<ul><li>ceases work</li>
<li>reduces the hours of employment to less than 30 hours per week, OR</li>
<li>has a reduction in employment income that makes DSP payable again.</li>
</ul><p>DSP can only be restored where the delegate is satisfied that the person is qualified for DSP and that DSP is payable. DSP is restored under the qualification criteria that applied to the person at the time of suspension.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Joe was granted DSP between 11 May 2005 and 30 June 2006 and had not been reviewed under the 15 hour rule.

The 30 hour rule applies to Joe when restoration of his DSP is being considered.</p>
</div>
<p>A person's payment may be restored subject to payability (e.g. income from employment), without the need to lodge a new DSP claim. The person MUST however request restoration of DSP.</p>
<p>If the person receives an alternative income support payment, such as JSP, during the suspension (or deemed suspension) period, the JSP must be cancelled in order to restore DSP.</p>
<p>If the person does not request restoration of DSP within the 2 year suspension period, the DSP MUST be cancelled.</p>
<p>If the person's DSP has been cancelled, and their circumstances change and they wish to reapply for DSP, they must meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

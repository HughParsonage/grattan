<h2>Qualification (<a href="../../1/1/q/10">1.1.Q.10</a>) criteria</h2>
<p>Clean energy advance (CEA) payments to eligible government payment recipients ceased on 31 December 2013.</p>
<p>The CEA was paid until clean energy supplement (CES) payments commenced (<a href="2">3.15.2</a>). From 20 September 2014 the <a href="../../acronyms#es" title="Energy supplement">ES</a> replaced the CES. From 20 March 2017, the ES was closed to new <a href="../../acronyms#cshc" title="Commonwealth seniors health card">CSHC</a> holders. Refer to <a href="2/30">3.15.2.30</a> for more details.</p>
<p>To qualify for a CEA, a person must have met the criteria listed in the table below. If more detail about a criterion is required, the second column contains or indicates where you will find this. The CEA was generally a one-off lump sum payment.</p>
<p>A person must have met ALL of the following:</p>

</div>
<h2>Duration of payment (CEA periods)</h2>
<p>People receiving a qualifying government payment received assistance through a CEA, delivered from May 2012, before the carbon price started on 1 July 2012. The lump sum CEAs were followed by regular, ongoing CES once the carbon price impact was reflected in the normal indexation of the person's qualifying payment.</p>
<p>The timing of the changeover from the CEA to the ongoing CES was set to coincide with normal indexation dates for qualifying payments. As indexation takes place at different times of the year for different payments, the period of time for which the CEA was expected to assist the recipient (the CEA period) varied according to payment type. CEA periods corresponding to the various qualifying payments are shown in the qualification table above.</p>
<p>The amount of a person's CEA was determined using the following calculation: the relevant 'CEA daily rate' multiplied by the number of days from the person's qualification day to the end of the person's relevant CEA period.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the person qualified for the CEA before 1 July 2012, the number of days had to be counted from 1 July 2012.</p>
<p>This meant that people who qualified for a CEA on or before 1 July 2012 received a full CEA, calculated from 1 July 2012 to the end of the CEA period that corresponded to their qualifying payment. People who first became qualified for a CEA after 1 July 2012 were paid a pro-rata CEA calculated from the day on which they first qualified for the CEA to the end of their CEA period.</p>
<p>There were 3 different CEA periods, depending upon the person's circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>The CEA period for people in receipt of various social security pensions or benefits other than Austudy, YA or DSP for a person who is under 21 with no dependent children began on 1 July 2012 and ended on 19 March 2013 - the 9 month CEA period.</li>
<li>The first of the 2 advance periods for people in receipt of Austudy, YA or DSP for a person who is under 21 without dependent children commenced on 1 July 2012 and ended on 30 June 2013 - the 12 month CEA period.</li>
<li>The second of the 2 advance periods for people in receipt of Austudy, YA or DSP for a person who is under 21 without dependent children commenced on 1 July 2013 and ended on 31 December 2013 - the 6 month CEA period.</li>

<h2>Claims</h2>
<p>A person did not need to make a specific claim in order to qualify for a CEA or to qualify for a CEA top-up payment if their circumstances changed. CEAs and top-ups were paid automatically to people who qualified. Payments began to be made according to the following schedule for people who qualified before 1 July 2012:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a> recipients - from 16 May 2012</li>
<li>Pension recipients - from 28 May 2012</li>
<li>Allowance recipients - from 11 June 2012</li>
<li>Seniors supplement recipients - from 23 June 2012</li>

</div>
<h2>Overseas absences</h2>
<p>A person did not receive a CEA while they were absent from Australia.</p>
<p>If a person normally resided in Australia and was receiving a qualifying payment while temporarily absent from Australia, they were tested for qualification for a CEA upon their return to Australia. If, upon return to Australia, the person qualified for a CEA and their absence from Australia was for a continuous period of no more than 13 weeks (6 weeks from 1 January 2013), they qualified for a full CEA. If the person's absence from Australia was greater than 13 weeks (6 weeks from 1 January 2013), they qualified for a pro-rata CEA calculated from the date of their return to the end of the relevant CEA period.</p>

</div>
<h2>Nil rate of payment</h2>
<p>Generally, people receiving a nil rate of social security payment did not qualify for a CEA until their rate returned to greater than nil. However, in certain circumstances a nil rate could be disregarded. These circumstances included where:</p>
<ul><li>a person's rate was nil on the determination day only because they had elected to receive their pension supplement quarterly,</li>
<li>a person's rate was nil on the determination day only because they had been paid an advance of <a href="../../acronyms#pha" title="Pharmaceutical allowance">PhA</a>, or</li>
<li>the person received <a href="../../acronyms#dfisa" title="Defence Force Income Support Allowance">DFISA</a> in addition to a nil rate of social security pension or benefit.</li>
</ul><p>In these circumstances, the person's nil rate should have been disregarded for determining eligibility for a CEA in respect of their social security payment.</p>

</div>
<h2>Duplicate payments (multiple qualification exclusion)</h2>
<p>Generally, a person could qualify for only 1 CEA for a given CEA period (and for no more than 2 CEAs in total). However, a person could qualify for more than 1 CEA in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>a person who qualified for a CEA as an FTB recipient may also have qualified for a CEA as a recipient of another government payment,</li>
<li>a person who received a social security qualifying payment as well as a <a href="../../acronyms#dva" title="Department of Veterans' Affairs">DVA</a> disability pension paid under <a href="../../acronyms#vea" title="Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986">VEA</a> Part II or Part IV at a rate determined by Division 4 of Part II of that Act may have received a CEA in respect of their social security payment as well as a CEA in respect of their VEA payment,</li>
<li>a person who received a social security qualifying payment as well as a permanent impairment payment or a special rate disability pension (SRDP) paid under the MRCA may have received a CEA in respect of each payment,</li>
<li>a person may have received a 12 month CEA, followed by a 6 month CEA, or</li>
<li>a person may have received a 9 month CEA and subsequently qualified for a 6 month CEA following a change in circumstances.</li>
</ul><p>A person could not qualify for both the 9 month and the 12 month CEA. For example, if a person received a 9 month CEA in respect of NSA and moved to Austudy on 1 February 2013, the person was not eligible for a pro-rata CEA in respect of Austudy, but may have been eligible for a top-up.</p>
<p>Multiple qualification exclusion criteria are contained in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2012L00948">Social Security (Clean Energy - Multiple Qualification Exclusion) (FaHCSIA) Determination 2012</a>, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2012L00984">Social Security (Clean Energy - Multiple Qualification Exclusion) (DEEWR) Determination 2012</a>, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2012L01009">Social Security (Clean Energy - Multiple Qualification Exclusion) (DIISRTE) Determination 2012</a> which are disallowable instruments made under SSAct section 918.</p>

<p>If a person had received a CEA and their circumstances changed so that they became eligible for a higher rate of payment or a qualifying payment that had a longer CEA period, they may have qualified for a top-up payment.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A person moved from <a href="../../acronyms#age" title="Age pension">Age</a> partnered to Age single.</p>
<p>The CEA daily rate for a person on a single rate of Age was higher than for a person on a partnered rate. This meant that a person initially paid a CEA at the partnered rate may not have been adequately assisted if they moved to a single rate during the CEA period. A top-up may have been paid to ensure that this person was appropriately assisted over the course of their advance period. The top-up was calculated so that the total CEA amount the person received was equivalent to receiving a partnered CEA daily rate from their original payment start day to the day before they changed to a single rate, and a single CEA daily rate from the change day to the end of the CEA period.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A person moved from <a href="../../acronyms#pps" title="Parenting payment (single)">PPS</a> to <a href="../../acronyms#austudy" title="Austudy payment">Austudy</a> single with child.</p>
</div>
<p>The CEA period corresponding to PPS was 9 months, whilst the CEA period corresponding to Austudy (single with child) was 12 months. As a result, a CEA paid to a person who subsequently moved from PPS to Austudy may not have provided assistance over the full course of their advance period/s. A top-up payment may have been paid for a person moving from PPS to Austudy (single with child) to ensure that the person received assistance appropriate to their circumstances over the course of the advance <span class="nobr">period/s</span> corresponding to their qualifying payments. The top-up was calculated so that the total CEA amount the person received was equivalent to being paid a PPS CEA daily rate from their original payment start day to the day before they changed payments, and an Austudy (single with child) CEA daily rate from the change day to the end of their new CEA period.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A person could not receive both a 9 and 12 month CEA.</p>
<p>The top-up was determined and automatically paid as soon as practicable after the change of circumstances.</p>

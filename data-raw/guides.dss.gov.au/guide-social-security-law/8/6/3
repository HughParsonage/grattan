</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note:</strong> These SS(Admin)Act section 109 rules do not apply to favourable determinations concerning resumption of payment after suspensions relating to non-compliance (see section 110A).</p>
<h2>Applying section 110</h2>
<p>The general rule is that the date of effect of a favourable determination made after the person has informed Centrelink of the occurrence of an event or change of circumstances (in accordance with a section 68 notice) is the LATER of the following dates:</p>
<ul><li>the date of notification (<a href="../../1/1/d/22">1.1.D.22</a>), or</li>
<li>the date of event (<a href="../../1/1/d/19">1.1.D.19</a>).</li>
</ul><p>This general rule does NOT apply in a range of circumstances set out in SS(Admin)Act sections 110(1A) - 110(11).</p>
<p>Section 110(2) provides that if a favourable determination is made after Centrelink has required a person to provide a statement about a matter that affects their payment, and the person has done so within the required timeframe (i.e. in accordance with a section 67 or 68 notice), the date of effect of the favourable determination is the date the matter arose.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> When the favourable determination is a result of a change in employment income. In this case section 110(2A) applies, see <a href="3#Favourabledeterminationsrelatingtoemploymentincome">'Favourable determinations relating to employment income'</a>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Statements required about a relevant matter include SU19s (<a href="../../acronyms#nsa" title="Newstart allowance">NSA</a>) and Reporting and Income Statement for other income support payments.</p>
</div>
<p>Section 110(3) applies where a person and their partner are both receiving a social security payment and the partner provides a statement to Centrelink (in accordance with a section 68 notice) about a matter than affects the partner's payment during a specified period. If a favourable determination is made as a result of this statement, the date of effect of that determination is the date the matter arose.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Occurs because of the employment income of a person or their partner who are under pension age. In this case section 110(3A) applies, see <a href="3#Favourabledeterminationsrelatingtoemploymentincome">'Favourable determinations relating to employment income'</a>.</p>
<p>The SS(Admin)Act sections governing other exceptions to the general rule are set out in the following table.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Determination Decision</th>
<th scope="col">SS(Admin)Act Reference</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Favourable determination follows death of partner.</td>
<td>subsection 110(4) or 110(5</td>
</tr><tr><td>Favourable determinations associated with refusal of or lack of qualification for prescribed educational scheme.</td>
<td>subsection 110(9), 110(10) or 110(11)</td>

<h2>Indexation or adjustment</h2>
<p>The date of effect of a rate increase determination made as a result of an amount being indexed or adjusted (through the operation of SSAct Part 3.16) is the day on which the indexation or adjustment occurred.</p>

</div>
<h2>Other favourable determinations</h2>
<p>Where a favourable determination is made (under section 85) to resume payment after a suspension relating to non-compliance, the date of effect is the day after the end of the period for which the payment is not payable.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This rule only applies to suspensions made under section 80 to certain types of social security payments (<a href="../../acronyms#pp" title="Parenting payment">PP</a>, <a href="../../acronyms#ya" title="Youth allowance">YA</a>, <a href="../../acronyms#austudy" title="Austudy payment">Austudy</a>, NSA and <a href="../../acronyms#spb" title="Special benefit">SpB</a>).</p>
<p>If none of sections 109, 110 or 110A apply then the date of effect of the favourable determination may be:</p>
<ul><li>the day on which the determination is made, or</li>
<li>another day specified in the determination, which may be:
<ul><li>later than the day the determination is made, or</li>
<li>not earlier than 13 weeks before the day the determination is made.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Favourable determinations relating to employment income</h2>
<p>The following provisions relate to favourable determinations due to a change in employment income, i.e. a rate increase or resumption of payment triggered by a decrease in or cessation of earnings. The provisions reflect the operation of SSAct section 1073B that allow a person below age pension age to have their employment income to be spread evenly over all of the days in the instalment period, regardless of the days that it was actually earned, derived or received. As a result, any favourable determination triggered by a decrease in or cessation of employment income may take effect on an earlier day than when their income was reduced or ceased.</p>
<p>Section 110(1A) applies to a notification reporter (<a href="../../1/1/n/126">1.1.N.126</a>) who has not reached pension age and provides that the date of effect for a favourable determination because employment income has decreased or ceased is the later of:</p>
<ul><li>the start of the instalment period in which the event occurred, or</li>
<li>the start of the instalment period in which the person advised the change.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Ellie receives <a href="../../acronyms#pps" title="Parenting payment (single)">PPS</a> and has a part-time employment contract for 3 months earning $500 every fortnight. She is a notification reporter. On day 5 of her instalment period her employment contract ceases, however she does not advise Centrelink until day 12 of the following instalment period, which is outside her 14 day notification period. The date of effect of the favourable determination is day 1 of the instalment period in which she advised the change (i.e. the instalment period after her employment ceased).</p>
</div>
<p>Section 110(2A) applies to a person who provides a statement (<a href="../../1/1/s/350">1.1.S.350</a>) advising their employment income has reduced or ceased. In this case the date of effect of the favourable determination is the start of the instalment period in which the event occurred.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Jeffrey receives NSA and has had casual employment of $300 per fortnight for the past 4 weeks. In his current instalment period his earnings are reduced to $250. He advises this on his SU19. The date of effect of the increase in his payment is day 1 of the instalment period.</p>
<p>In his following instalment period, Jeffrey's employment ceases on day 7 of the instalment period. The date of effect for the favourable determination is day 1 of the instalment period and his earnings from day 1 up to and including day 7 are spread over the full instalment period.</p>
<p>Section 110(3A) applies where:</p>
<ul><li>the person and the person's partner both receive a social security payment,</li>
<li>the person's partner is under pension age,</li>
<li>the person's partner is required to give the department a statement in respect of an instalment period, and</li>
<li>the person's partner gives the department a statement about the partner's employment income in the instalment period (for a favourable determination, this will mean that the partner's employment income has reduced or ceased in the instalment period).</li>
</ul></div>
<p>If, following this, a favourable determination is made in relation to the person's social security payment because the partner's employment income has reduced or ceased, the date of effect of the person's favourable determination is the first day of the PARTNER'S instalment period in which the event occurred. This applies whether the person's instalment period and the partner's instalment period are aligned or not.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Luke and his partner Linda are both receiving a social security payment (<a href="../../1/1/s/210">1.1.S.210</a>). Linda is a statement reporter (<a href="../../1/1/s/350">1.1.S.350</a>) and is under age pension age. Linda has been working casually and on day 8 of her instalment period her employment ceases and Linda provides this information in her statement. The date of effect of the favourable determination for Luke is the first day of Linda's instalment period (because of the operation of section 110(3A)). The date of effect of the favourable determination for Linda is the first day of her instalment period (because of the operation of section 110(2A)). Linda's employment income earned during the instalment period (in this case from day 1 up to and including day 7 of the period) is spread over the full instalment period.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Favourabledeterminationsrelatingtoemploymentincome">Favourable determinations relating to concession cards</h2>
<p>If a decision is made that a person is not qualified for a concession card, the person seeks review of that decision and a favourable determination to resume the person's qualification is made, the date of effect of that favourable determination should be worked out in accordance with the following table.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th scope="col">If a notice advising of the original decision…</th>
<th scope="col">And the person lodges an application for review of original decision…</th>
<th scope="col">Then the date of effect of the favourable determination is…</th>
<th scope="col">SS(Admin)Act Reference</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HAS been given to the person,</td>

</tr></tbody></table><p>If a decision is made that a person is not qualified for a concession card, and the person is given notice of the decision and does not appeal, but the delegate decides that the person is qualified for the concession card, the date of effect of the new, favourable determination is the date of effect of the original decision.</p>

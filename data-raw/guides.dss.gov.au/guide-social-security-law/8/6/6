<h1 >8.6.6 Summary of Rules for Date of Effect - Determinations Not Involving Working Credit or Student Income Bank</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section deals with situations where a person's claim for a social security payment has already been granted and a change in the person's circumstances affects the continuation of the payment or the rate of payment to which the person is entitled.</p>
<p>The table below sets out the date of effect rules related to the conditions required to distinguish one rule from another, together with references to the authorising legislative provisions. The legislation is organised by the types of determination, which the Secretary makes in response to changes in a person's circumstances. To work out the category of determination, you need to decide:</p>
<ul><li>whether the determination is 'favourable' or 'adverse',</li>
<li>whether the determination is 'automatic' or 'non-automatic', and</li>
<li>whether the person is a 'notification reporter' or a 'statement reporter'.</li>
</ul><p>This table applies to:</p>
<ul><li>all persons of age pension age for all determinations, and</li>
<li>all persons below age pension age for determinations made about an event or change in circumstances which does not involve employment income (for working credit persons) or ordinary income (for student income bank persons).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> This table does not apply to determinations concerning concession cards. See SS(Admin)Act Part 3 Division 8 Subdivision B and C. Additionally, there are further rules that apply to determine the date of effect in the case of <a href="../../acronyms#cp" title="Carer payment">CP</a> (see section 120).</p>

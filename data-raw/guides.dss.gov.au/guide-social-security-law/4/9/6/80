<h3>Stage 1 - assessment of income stream between operative time &amp; date of 'first splittable payment'</h3>
<p>No income assessed.<br />
	Any income paid out during this period is treated as an 'exempt lump sum'.</p>
<h3>Stage 2 - assessment of income streams from date of first splittable payment onwards (i.e. after the first splittable payment)</h3>
<p>First splittable payment is assessed as an exempt lump sum and therefore does not feature in the income test.</p>
<p>If only part of the 'base amount payment' is satisfied via the first splittable payment, and the remaining portion of the base amount is paid via 'split' income stream payments, then calculate assessable income for member (<a href="../../../1/1/m/118">1.1.M.118</a>) (primary FLA) and non-member (<a href="../../../1/1/n/115">1.1.N.115</a>) (secondary FLA) as follows.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h2 id="purchasedpre">ATE income streams purchased pre-20 September 2004 - subsequent commutations made by member (income test assessment)</h2>
<p>The member may commute part of the original income stream after the operative time. The family law provisions treat such commutations in the same way as for a 'percentage payment split' (<a href="30">4.9.6.30</a>), i.e. any commuted amounts must be apportioned between the primary FLA and the secondary FLA. The apportionment will be determined in accordance with the percentage of the split payment that goes to the primary FLA, and the percentage of the split payment that goes to the secondary FLA.</p>
<p>After the commutation is made, the new gross income amount must be obtained from the fund trustee for both the member (primary FLA) and non-member (secondary FLA). The NPP for each member and non-member must be reduced by his or her share of the commutation. This variation to NPP will mean that the deduction amount (and assessable income) for each member and non-member will also have to be adjusted.</p>
<h2 id="purchasedfrom">ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - assets test assessment</h2>
<p>The calculation of asset values for ATE income streams purchased on or after 20 September 2004 is undertaken as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Calculate asset values using the methodology specified in the section 'Asset-tested income stream (long term) - assets test assessment' below.</li>
<li>Take 50% of these asset values.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As ATE income streams do not have a <a href="../../../acronyms#rcv" title="Residual capital value">RCV</a>, any reference to the calculation of a RCV should be ignored.</p>
<h2 id="incometestassessment">ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - income test assessment</h2>
<p>The calculation of assessable income is the same as for ATE income streams purchased pre-20 September 2004.</p>
<h2 id="subsequentcommutations">ATE income streams purchased from 20 September 2004 to 19 September 2007 - subsequent commutations made by member (income test assessment)</h2>
<p>The calculation of assessable income is the same as for ATE income streams purchased pre-20 September 2004 - (income test assessment) subsequent commutations made by member.</p>
<h2 id="assettested">Asset-tested income streams (long term) &amp; asset-tested income streams (lifetime)</h2>
<p>The following methodology assumes that the full base amount is paid from the income stream product. Where the member's original superannuation interest includes other superannuation components (i.e. other income streams, superannuation lump sums, etc.), and part of the base amount is paid from those components, the values of BA (base amount) and V (value of member's superannuation interest) below will need to be adjusted accordingly.</p>

The family law provisions treat such commutations in the same way as for a percentage payment split (<a href="30">4.9.6.30</a>), i.e. any commuted amounts must be apportioned between the primary FLA and the secondary FLA. The apportionment will be determined in accordance with the percentage of the split payment that goes to the primary FLA, and the percentage of the split payment that goes to the secondary FLA.</p>

<div class="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Henry buys a fixed term pension from the ZYX Super Fund on 1 January 1998 that makes the first income payment on 1 February 1998. His income stream is assessed by Centrelink as an 'asset tested income stream (long term)'.</p>
<p>Purchase price = $500,000</p>
<p>Term = 20 years</p>
<p>Pension payments = $45,000 p.a. (payable once a year)</p>
<p>RCV = nil</p>
<p>Henry commutes $50,000 on 1 January 2003 and his pension payments are reduced to $39,500 p.a.</p>
<p>Henry and Wilma subsequently divorce and on 2 January 2005, the court awards a base amount of $200,000 from Henry's income stream. The operative time is 1 January 2005.</p>
<p>As a result of the court order, Wilma receives the full amount of the first payment from the income stream (the first splittable payment) of $39,500 on 1 February 2005. Wilma then requests 25% of the remaining base amount as a lump sum. The remainder of the base amount will then be paid to Wilma as a secondary FLA, determined in accordance with Division 6.3 of the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations 2001.</p>
<p>The superannuation fund paying Henry's pension notifies Wilma that she will receive a lump sum of $38,120 and a secondary FLA of $16,530 p.a.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The figure of $38,120 that Wilma receives is not 25% of $200,000 reduced by $39,500, i.e. $40,125. The difference between the 2 figures arises because of the need to take account of the pension valuation factors that apply to the commutation. Further details on these factors are contained in Regulation 58(5) of the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations 2001.</p>
<p>Henry's annual payments (the primary FLA) will be $18,200 p.a. The first of the split payments to Henry and Wilma commence on 1 February 2006.</p>

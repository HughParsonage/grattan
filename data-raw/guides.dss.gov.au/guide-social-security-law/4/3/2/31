<h2>Ministerial determination: 'approved' personal care support schemes</h2>
<p>The Minister for Social Services may approve personal care support schemes under SSAct section 35A. Payments from 'approved schemes' that are paid towards the cost of personal care support services and do not provide income support for the person who is receiving care are exempt from the income test under SSAct section 8(8)(zi), but ONLY in the hands of the person who is receiving care. Payments that do not belong to the person receiving care are not exempt under section 35A. Payments are not exempt in the hands of the carer.</p>
<p>Agencies and organisations that provide assistance to people with care needs can apply to have their schemes considered as 'approved schemes' under section 35A. Approval of these schemes for income test purposes is obtained through Means Test Policy Section in DSS.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Some organisations and agencies give a person with a disability money to:</p>
<ul><li>meet the cost of a carer or attendant to provide personal care, and</li>
<li>reimburse the carer for expenses incurred in providing personal care support services.</li>
</ul><p>Payments are either made to the person:</p>
<ul><li>with a disability to pay the person providing the care, or</li>
<li>providing the personal care for the person with a disability.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The Minister for Social Services may approve personal care support schemes for both groups and individuals.</p>
<p>Under current Administrative Arrangements Orders (AAOs), DSS is responsible for administering income support payments under the social security law. Determinations are signed by the Minister for Social Services.</p>
<h2>Ministerial determination: date of effect of determination</h2>
<p>The Minister's power, under SSAct section 35A to determine an 'approved personal care support scheme' is exercised by making a legislative instrument that is lodged with the Federal Register of Legislation. A determination, once made, is subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament in accordance with the Legislation Act 2003. The interaction between section 35A and the date of effect rules in the SS(Admin)Act, mean that a rate increase decision or a resumption of payment decision after suspension resulting from the impact of section 35A determination can only be backdated in some cases, for up to 13 weeks, to the date the section 35A determination causes the relevant rate increase decision or resumption decision.</p>

<h2>Secretarial approval: approved exchange trading systems</h2>
<p>Credits received from participation in approved <a href="../../../acronyms#ets" title="Exchange trading systems">ETS</a> are NOT treated as income for social security purposes (see list below for approved ETS).</p>
<p>Where the ETS does not have specific approval, its credits are assessed as income. The value of one credit is usually equivalent to one dollar unless there is another means of placing a reasonable dollar value on the credits.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example: </strong>An ETS may pay a person $15 cash an hour, but if paying for the same task in credits, the person may accrue 60 credits. In this case, each credit is equivalent to 25 cents.</p>
</div>
<p>IF both cash and credits in ETS schemes are received, the cash amount IS assessed as income.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> ETS are community-based schemes where goods and services are exchanged without money. ETS schemes have a local unit of exchange, often called an 'eco', but other names for the unit of exchange are also used.</p>
<p>To be exempt from the income test the scheme has to be an 'approved scheme' under the Act.</p>
<p>The Secretary may class an ETS as an 'approved scheme' if it meets criteria stated in the Act that:</p>
<ul><li>it is a local community-based system, and</li>
<li>its primary purpose is to help persons maintain their labour skills and keep them in touch with the labour market, and</li>
<li>it is not a system run by a person or organisation for profit.</li>

</tr></tbody></table><p>Approval of these schemes for income test purposes is obtained through Means Test Policy Section in DSS.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although these schemes are approved for income testing purposes this does not mean that they are approved for activity testing purposes.</p>
<p>Participation in this type of scheme is not an approved activity and is therefore not an acceptable activity for inclusion in a Job Plan. This is because participation in such a scheme does not help or encourage job seekers to take up paid employment and leave income support. Because the remuneration provided is not treated as income under the SSAct, a participant can continue to receive their full rate of payment as well as their 'trade dollars', which could in fact provide an incentive for them to remain on income support. However, a job seeker can participate in such a scheme for up to 20 hours per week provided they continue to fully satisfy the activity test and demonstrate their commitment to obtaining full-time paid employment.</p>

<h2>Secretarial determination: lump sums exempted under section 8(11)</h2>
<p>For the list of exempt lump sums see <a href="35">4.3.2.35</a> Income Exempt from Assessment - s8(11) Exempt Lump Sums.</p>
<p>Further references to more general exempt lump sums (such as a non-periodical lottery win) can be located in <a href="30">4.3.2.30</a> Income Exempt from Assessment - Legislated, details in Exempt lump sums.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The initial exemption of a lump sum amount from the income test does NOT mean that any on-going income generated by the lump sum is exempt, nor does it mean that the asset the lump sum turns into is exempt. The continuing assets and income tests treatment will be determined by how a person makes use of the funds. The funds may be used to obtain additional assets such as a car. For a purchase such as this the assets test would apply. Or, the funds may be placed in a financial investment. The funds have then become a financial asset (refer to SSAct section 9(1) for all the types of financial assets), assessable as an asset and subject to the income test deeming rules.</p>

<h2>Solar feed-in tariffs</h2>
<p>Solar feed-in tariffs paid as an electricity account credit are not assessed as income for pension purposes. Solar feed-in tariffs paid as cash to pensioners (for example by cheque or by direct deposit) are counted as income for pension purposes.</p>
<p>Each solar feed-in tariff paid as cash is considered as income for 12 months.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example: </strong>A pensioner receiving a cheque from their electricity company for $260 has the amount counted as $10 income a fortnight for 26 fortnights.</p>

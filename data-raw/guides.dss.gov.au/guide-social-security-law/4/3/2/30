</div>
<h2>Free or discounted accommodation</h2>
<p>When a person receives free or discounted accommodation, the value of the free or discounted accommodation is NOT income for social security purposes. See below under 'Value of board or lodging'.</p>
<h2>Value of board or lodging</h2>
<p>The value of board and lodging is not income for social security purposes under SSAct section 8(8)(za).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Where a person receives free accommodation, board or lodging.</p>
</div>
<p>Where a person receives a reduction in the rent or charge for accommodation or a reduction in the rent or charge for board or lodging, the value of this reduction is NOT income for social security purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Where a person receives a direct payment in cash, for the purpose of meeting the costs of their accommodation, board or lodging expenses, this IS income.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Examples</strong> of the value of board or lodging are:</p>
<ul><li>If an employer provides free accommodation, board or lodging as part of an employee's entitlements, the value of the accommodation or board or lodging is NOT treated as income of the employee for social security purposes.</li>
<li>If a scholarship includes either free (or a reduced charge for) accommodation, the value of the free (or reduced charge for) accommodation is NOT income for social security purposes.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>For the treatment of income from board and lodgings (i.e. in the hands of the provider), see <a href="../8/40">4.3.8.40</a>.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 8(8)(za) the value of board or lodgingâ¦</p>
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../3/60">4.3.3.60</a> Deferred Income, Salary Sacrifice, Valuable Consideration &amp; Fringe Benefits</p>
</div>
<h2>Value of emergency relief or like assistance, including natural disaster funds</h2>
<p>The value of emergency relief or like assistance is exempt as income under SSAct section 8(8)(c). However, depending on how the money is used, it may be treated as an asset under the assets test and, if invested, may be deemed to earn income under the income test.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Examples</strong> of emergency relief or like assistance are:</p>
<ul><li>state government financial assistance to victims of bushfires,</li>
<li>Bali Emergency Relief,</li>
<li>payment of Transition to Independent Living Allowance (TILA) to or on behalf of young people leaving state-supported care,</li>
<li>drought financial assistance, and</li>
<li>flood financial assistance.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> This list is not exhaustive.</p>
</div>
<p>Payments from trust funds that pay out assistance to people suffering losses from natural disasters are one-time relief payments, and are NOT regarded as income for social security purposes.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 8(8)(c) the value of emergency reliefâ¦</p>

</div>
<h2>Treatment of compensation &amp; insurance payments for buildings, plant or personal effects</h2>
<p>If a person receives compensation or an insurance payment to repay debt (e.g. consumer credit insurance) or for damage to their buildings, plant or personal effects, that payment is NOT treated as income for social security purposes.</p>
<p>If the payment is for damage to buildings, plant or personal effects, and is held as a financial investment, the financial investment and any interest earned are NOT deemed under the income test for up to 12 months after the person receives the payment.</p>
<p>The exemption from the income test deeming rules MAY be extended past 12 months if the person can show that they meant to spend the compensation or insurance payment on repairs within 12 months, but that they were not able to do so for reasons beyond their control.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the payment is not invested, but spent for another purpose, it may become immediately assessable under the income and assets tests.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the money is used to purchase motor vehicles, the value of the motor vehicles is assessed under the assets test.</p>
</div>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 8(8)(k) insurance or compensationâ¦, section 8(8)(ka) where: the person owes moneyâ¦, section 8(8)(m) money from an investment â¦, section 1084(1) Certain money and financial investments not taken into account</p>
</div>
<h2>Payments from medically acquired HIV trusts</h2>
<p>Payments from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust and the NSW Trust are a combination of lump sums and periodic payments and are NOT treated as income for social security purposes under the compensation and income test provisions.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Mark Fitzpatrick Trust was established in 1989 by the Commonwealth Government to provide special financial assistance to people with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS, their dependents and carers.</li>
<li>The NSW Government has established the NSW Medically Acquired HIV Trust to provide financial assistance packages for people with medically acquired HIV or AIDS in NSW. The Mark Fitzpatrick Trust acts as a payment agency on behalf of the NSW Medically Acquired HIV Trust.</li>
</ul></div>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> The continuing assets and income tests treatment will be determined by how a person makes use of the funds. The funds may be used to obtain additional assets such as a car. For a purchase such as this the assets test would apply. Or, the funds may be placed in a financial investment. The funds have then become a financial asset (refer to SSAct section 9(1) for all the types of financial assets), assessable as an asset and subject to the income test deeming rules.</p>
<div class="reference">
<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 8(8)(va) a payment made by the Mark Fitzpatrick Trustâ¦, section 9(1) Financial assets and income streams definitions, section 1071 Seniors Health Card Taxable Income Test Calculator</p>
<p><strong>Policy reference:</strong> SS Guide <a href="../../4">4.4</a> Deeming Provisions</p>
</div>
<h2>Private health insurance rebate</h2>
<p>The <cite>Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998</cite> provides for a 30% private health insurance rebate/benefit from 1 January 1999. This rebate/benefit is NOT income for social security purposes, as it is merely refunding money already assessed as part of gross income.</p>
<h2>Blocked income</h2>
<p>The term 'blocked' is used if a person has severely limited or no access to income. The treatment of blocked foreign income is dealt with by the Federal Court in <cite>Rose v Secretary, Department of Social Security</cite> (1990) 21 FCR 241. The <cite>Rose</cite> decision held that no territorial limitation could be implied into the definition of income. When access to a foreign pension is severely limited, for example, the paying country restricts payment of pensions overseas, or access is restricted to residents of or to people physically present in the paying country, does NOT mean the pension is considered 'blocked'.</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, however, it MAY be accepted that a pension is NOT income for social security purposes, where the prospect of receiving the money is so remote that the monies are not 'earned, derived or received' for the person's own use or benefit.</p>

</div>
<h2>Payments exempted under international agreements</h2>
<p>International agreements contain income-testing concessions on certain types of payments made by the agreement partners.</p>

<h2>NEIS payments</h2>
<p>NEIS payments are not treated as ordinary income. However, they are direct deductions for MOST payments. Refer to the Act reference for further information.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> NEIS is funded by the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><strong>Act reference:</strong> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04121" title="Social Security Act 1991">SSAct</a> section 1186 General effect of Part, section 1187 Reduction in rate of paymentsâ¦, section 1188 Rate reduction under this Part</p>

</div>
<h2>NDIS amounts &amp; returns on NDIS amounts</h2>
<p>NDIS amounts (<a href="../../../1/1/n/03">1.1.N.03</a>), received by an NDIS participant (<a href="../../../1/1/n/05">1.1.N.05</a>) as part of the participant's NDIS plan (<a href="../../../1/1/n/06">1.1.N.06</a>), are exempt income for the NDIS participant.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> NDIS amounts are to provide care and support for people with disability and are not for the NDIS participant's income support.</p>
</div>
<p>The exemption of NDIS amounts under the income test only applies in the hands of the NDIS participant.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If NDIS amounts are used to pay a person to provide care and/or support for the NDIS participant, the amount paid is treated as employment income (<a href="../../../1/1/e/102">1.1.E.102</a>) for the person providing the care and/or support.</p>
</div>
<p>Any actual returns that are earned, derived or received on NDIS amounts are also exempt income.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> NDIS participants who self-manage their NDIS amount in accordance with their NDIS plan may hold unspent NDIS amounts to pay for future disability expenses, and may earn interest on those amounts. This interest is also exempt from the income test.</p>
</div>
<p>A means test exemption applies to NDIS amounts in the hands of the NDIS participant:</p>

<h2>Exempt lump sums</h2>
<p>Some lump sums are NOT treated as income for social security purposes. These lump sums are defined by their characteristics rather than by nominated lump sum types. These characteristics are:</p>
<ul><li>unlikely to be repeated, and</li>
<li>cannot be reasonably expected to be received or necessarily anticipated, and</li>
<li>do not represent receipt of money for services rendered directly or indirectly.</li>
</ul><p>They include items like:</p>
<ul><li>one-off gifts, irrespective of the source of the gifts, if they are not of a periodical nature or representing a form of continuous support,</li>
<li>windfall gains such as lottery winnings, or the distribution of capital from a legacy or inheritance, or prizes/awards.</li>
</ul><p>The characteristics of these payments still have to be considered as the amount will not be an exempt lump sum in all circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the treatment of a lump sum withdrawal from a superannuation fund (see <a href="../../8/2/30">4.8.2.30</a>). For the treatment of a lump sum commutation from an income stream (see <a href="../../9/1/10">4.9.1.10</a>).</p>
<p>The transfer of an income stream to a reversionary beneficiary is located in <a href="../../9/1/20">4.9.1.20</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Periodical lottery winnings that are a series of payments under one contract - each instalment is assessed as income over the period it represents. For example, each instalment of $50,000 paid once a year would be held as income over 12 months.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> For lottery winnings received in annual instalments of $50,000 per year for 20 years, each instalment is assessed as income over 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The initial exemption of a lump sum amount from the income test does NOT mean that any on-going income generated by the lump sum is exempt, nor does it mean that the asset the lump sum turns into is exempt. The continuing assets and income tests treatment will be determined by how a person makes use of the funds. The funds may be used to obtain additional assets such as a car. For a purchase such as this the assets test would apply. Or, the funds may be invested in a financial investment. The funds have then become a financial asset (refer to SSAct section 9(1) for all the types of financial assets), assessable as an asset and subject to the income test deeming rules.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 2 child support Acts contain secrecy provisions. These restrict the communication of 'protected information' and specify when and to whom the Registrar, or a person authorised by the Registrar can lawfully release information.</p>

</ul><h2 id="protected">Protected information</h2>
<p>Protected information is personal information that a person obtains while performing their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation. Any personal information gathered by <a href="../../../guide-social-security-law/acronyms#dss" title="Department of Social Services">DSS</a>, Services Australia, Services Australia employees and contractors, and other government agencies for the purposes of administering the child support legislation is protected information.</p>
<h2 id="people">People covered by the secrecy provisions</h2>
<p>The secrecy provisions of the child support legislation apply to all people occupying positions where they may obtain protected information about a person in the course of their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation. These are:</p>
<ul><li>the Child Support Registrar</li>
<li>the Minister for Human Services</li>
<li>the Minister for Social Services</li>
<li>the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia</li>
<li>the Secretary of DSS</li>
<li>Services Australia employees</li>
<li>DSS employees</li>
<li>the Commissioner of Taxation</li>
<li>a person employed or appointed by, or providing services to, the Commonwealth</li>
<li>the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or an officer of that department who has received information in relation to overseas maintenance orders or the enforcement of child support overseas</li>
<li>any person if the information concerns a credible threat to the life, health or welfare of a person</li>
<li>a person with a 'sufficient interest'</li>
<li>a payee of a registered maintenance liability or carer liability who has notified Services Australia in accordance with CSRC Act section 113A of their intention to institute private payee enforcement proceedings</li>
<li>members of the <a href="../../acronyms#aat" title="Administrative Appeals Tribunal">AAT</a></li>
<li>officers of the Court.</li>
</ul><p>The secrecy provisions continue to apply to a person after they cease performing those duties.</p>
<h2 id="offence">Offence to record or communicate protected information unless exceptions apply</h2>
<p>It is an offence under the secrecy provisions for a person to make a record of any protected information. It is also an offence for a person to communicate protected information about a person to someone other than that person (CSRC Act section 16(2), CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(2)).</span></p>
<p>The exception is where the person records or communicates the information for the purposes of the child support legislation, or where they are required to do so as part of their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(2A), CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(2A)).</span></p>
<p>This means that Services Australia can make a record of personal information where that information is needed to administer a person's child support case. Services Australia staff can access and use this personal information when they need it to carry out their duties, but not for other purposes. Services Australia can disclose protected information about a person to the person, their authorised representative, or to a person authorised by law. When an officer discloses information they must ensure they only pass information to a person entitled to receive it.</p>
<p>Another offence under the secrecy provisions applies to the unauthorised use of information by persons other than those listed above. For example, this offence would apply where personal information from Services Australia is sent incorrectly to a person (e.g. a letter is sent to the wrong person) and that person then records, communicates or otherwise uses that information (CSA Act section 150AA and CSRC Act section 16AA). This offence does not apply if the personal information was obtained legally from a source other than the records of Services Australia or a relevant department.</p>
<p>The penalty for breaching the secrecy provisions of the child support legislation is imprisonment for one year. See <a href="../8.1">6.8</a> for more information on the secrecy offences.</p>
<h2 id="when">When protected information can be disclosed to another person</h2>
<p>Certain provisions in the child support legislation require the Registrar to provide protected information about an individual to a person other than that individual. It is not an offence to disclose protected information where the disclosure is required or authorised by law.</p>
<h2 id="consent">Disclosure by consent</h2>
<p>The Registrar is authorised to communicate protected information to a person who has the consent of the person (to whom the information relates) to obtain that information (CSA Act section 150(3)(f) and CSRC Act <span class="nobr">section 16(3)(f)).</span></p>
<h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure to the other parent</h2>
<p>Assessment Notices: Services Australia discloses some personal information about one parent to the other parent in child support assessment notices. This information can include the parent's name and income, the number and age ranges of any dependent children the parent has, and the number and age ranges of any other children the parent is assessed to pay child support for (CSA Act section 76). The purpose of this disclosure is to provide the other parent with enough information to understand how the child support assessment is calculated and, if they think the assessment is unfair or incorrect, to exercise their rights to challenge the assessment. This disclosure is required by law and is therefore also permitted under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712"><cite>Privacy Act 1988</cite></a>.</p>
<p>Information about debt recovery action: The Registrar is also authorised to take such steps as the Registrar considers appropriate to inform a payee of action taken to recover their child support debt or carer debt (CSRC Act section 113(2)). This means Services Australia may disclose some personal information about the payer to the payee. Services Australia will not disclose personal information that is not directly relevant or necessary to keep the payee informed (e.g. Services Australia will not disclose the name of the payer's employer, that they are unemployed, or the name of their bank).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Services Australia advises Basmat (the payee) that litigation action is being taken and a judgment against the property of Eppie (the payer) is being sought. Services Australia does not advise Basmat of the details of Eppie's property.</p>
<p>Services Australia advises Leonard (the payee) that a warrant of execution has been issued against Anastasia (the payer) which was returned because the court was unable to find any assets to seize.</p>
<p>Services Australia advises Arthur (the payee) that Deborah's tax refund has been intercepted.</p>
<p>Services Australia advises Erica(the payee) that employer withholding to collect child support from Bernard (the payer) is being arranged. Services Australia does not tell Erica the name of Bernard's employer, or the date that Bernard started work.</p>
<p>Services Australia advises Cornelia (the payee) that a Departure Prohibition Order (DPO) has been issued to prevent Fernando (the payer) from leaving the country. Services Australia does not tell Cornelia where Fernando was intending to travel to, or the dates of the travel.</p>
<p>Services Australia advises Jaxson (the payee) that a DPO has not been issued despite receiving information from Jaxson that Neha (the payer) was intending to travel. Services Australia does not disclose to Jaxson the specific reasons for this decision.</p>
</div>
<p>Information for private payee enforcement proceedings: Necessary information may be released by Services Australia to a requesting payee (CSA Act section 150(4G) and CSRC Act section 16(4G)) where they have notified the Registrar of their intention to institute court proceedings to recover a child support debt or a carer debt in accordance with CSRC Act section 113A. However, any information released by Services Australia would be for those proceedings only and the person receiving the information would become subject to the secrecy provisions in their handling of the information.</p>
<p>Change of assessment: When a parent applies for a change of assessment, the Registrar must send a copy of the application form (including detailed financial information and any accompanying documentation) to the other parent (CSA Act section 98G(1)). The Registrar will then seek a response from the other parent and send a copy of the response to the applicant, along with any accompanying documents (CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 98G(3)).</span></p>
<p>Objections: When a parent has objected to a decision, the Registrar is required to send the objection and accompanying documents to the other parent (CSRC Act section 85). The Registrar will seek a response from the other parent. In order to make a decision in a way that is procedurally fair, Services Australia will necessarily discuss a parent's personal information with the other parent. The purpose of this disclosure is to provide the other parent with enough information to be able to comment on any information that is being considered by the Registrar and to allow them to be able to exercise their rights to challenge the decision. This disclosure is necessary in order to make a decision under the child support legislation. As it is for the purposes of the child support legislation, the disclosure is permitted by the secrecy provisions.</p>
<p>AAT review: See <a href="3#administrative">Disclosure to the AAT</a> below.</p>
<h2 id="one">Disclosure to a person other than the other parent</h2>
<p>The Registrar may obtain information and collect relevant debts from third parties such as employers, banks, accountants, trustees in bankruptcy and lawyers. In order to do this, Services Australia may disclose some personal information about parents to third parties. The information that Services Australia may disclose could include identity details such as name, address or date of birth, the amount of child support payable, and the amount of unpaid child support.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The Registrar sends a notice to Martina's employer which includes personal information about Martina. The notice includes Martina's name, address, date of birth and specifies the amount of child support to be deducted from Martina's wages.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="two">Disclosure to an authorised representative</h2>
<p>Services Australia can communicate with a person who has been authorised to receive information on behalf of a parent or carer. This may involve Services Australia disclosing protected information to the authorised representative, including information about the other party in the child support case that would otherwise be <a href="3#disclosure">disclosed to the parent or carer</a>. More information about dealing with authorised representatives is also available in <a href="6">6.3.6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="three">Disclosure to specified government agencies &amp; office holders</h2>
<p>Protected information can be communicated by the Registrar, or officers with appropriate authority, to specified government agencies and office holders in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>DSS: Protected information can be communicated to the Social Services Secretary or an officer or an employee of DSS for the purposes of administering the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(3)(a) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(a)).</span></p>
<p>Human Services Secretary and Chief Executive Centrelink: Protected information can be communicated to these officers and to other authorised officers or employees where this is for the purposes of administering the child support legislation or Commonwealth laws for pensions, benefits or allowances (CSRC Act section 16(3)(ba) and CSA Act section 150(3)(ba)). The information able to be disclosed includes details of the amount of child support a parent is entitled to be paid and the amount of child support that has been paid to the payee. This allows for assessment and adjustment of parents' benefits accordingly. Services Australia can also pass on information that could help to identify fraudulent pension claims and respond to specific requests for information from Centrelink.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Medicare: Protected information can be communicated to the Chief Executive Medicare and to other authorised officers or employees, where this is for the purpose of the performance of functions or the exercise of powers under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A00100"><cite>Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973</cite></a> (CSRC Act section 16(3)(bb) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(bb)).</span></p>
<p>Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA): Services Australia can communicate protected information to the Secretary of DVA or an officer or employee of DVA, where this is for the purposes of administering Commonwealth laws for pensions, benefits or allowances (CSRC Act section 16(3)(b) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(b)).</span></p>
<p><a href="../../acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a>: Services Australia can communicate protected information to a person performing duties under or in relation to legislation administered by the Commissioner of Taxation to allow them to perform those duties (CSRC Act section 16(3)(ca) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(ca)).</span></p>
<p>Services Australia exchanges personal information such as names and tax file numbers with the ATO. This exchange enables Services Australia to determine when new taxable income information is available for parents. The exchange also allows Services Australia to identify when a person has both a tax refund amount due and a relevant debt owing (see <a href="../../5/2/8">5.2.8</a>), as the Registrar may require the ATO to pay the amount to be applied to the relevant debt.</p>
<p>Attorney-General's Department: Services Australia can communicate protected information to the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or an officer or employee of that department, for the purposes of enforcing overseas maintenance liabilities (CSRC Act section 16(3)(d) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(d)).</span></p>
<h2 id="cont">Disclosure to contractors &amp; others providing services to the Commonwealth</h2>
<p>Services Australia can communicate protected information to a person performing duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation to allow them to perform those duties (CSRC Act section 16(3)(c) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(c)).</span></p>
<h2 id="four">Disclosure to any person to prevent credible threat</h2>
<p>Services Australia can communicate protected information to any person if the information concerns a credible threat to the life, health, or welfare of a person and:</p>
<ul><li>Services Australia believes on reasonable grounds that the communication is necessary to prevent or lessen the threat, or</li>
<li>there is reason to suspect that the threat may afford evidence that an offence may be, or has been, committed against a person and the information is communicated for the purpose of preventing, investigating or prosecuting such an offence.</li>
</ul><p>See CSRC Act section 16(3)(e), CSA Act section 150(3)(e), and <a href="../10.1">6.10</a> for information about family violence.</p>
<h2 id="five">Disclosure to a court</h2>
<p>It is not an offence under the child support legislation for Services Australia to communicate protected information to a court because a court is not a person. However, Services Australia is not required to communicate protected information to a court except for the purposes of either of the child support Acts (CSRC Act section 16(5) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(5)).</span></p>
<p>The exception is where a court has ordered the Registrar to provide information about a child's location (FL Act section 67J). These orders are referred to as Commonwealth information orders or location orders. They are mandatory and a person must comply with them in spite of any other law (FL Act sections 67M(6) and 67N(10)). The secrecy provisions in the child support legislation also make it clear that the Registrar must comply with Commonwealth information orders or location orders (CSRC Act section 16(9) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(9)).</span></p>
<p>See <a href="../4.1">6.4</a> for information about subpoenas.</p>
<h2 id="administrative">Disclosure to the AAT</h2>
<p>The AAT, like the court, has the authority to require the production of documents or the answering of questions (CSRC Act section 16(1) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(1)).</span></p>
<h3>Review of a decision of the Registrar</h3>
<p>When a parent applies to the AAT for a first or second review of a decision, the Registrar is required to send the AAT and the parties to the review a statement about the decision and copies of any documents that are relevant to the review of the decision (AAT Act section 37 and CSRC Act sections 95C). The parties will generally be both parents, the Registrar and any other person who has been made a party to the review. The AAT may also ask the Registrar to provide or obtain additional information for the purposes of the review (CSRC Act section 95G and section 95J).</p>
<p>See <a href="../../4/2.1">4.2</a> for further information about AAT review of decisions.</p>
<p>In some situations the AAT may direct a person not to disclose the information in the statement or document or may limit its use for particular purposes. The AAT can also direct the Registrar not to disclose a statement or document or can direct that its disclosure be restricted (AAT Act section 35(3), section 35(4) and CSRC Act section 98B, section 98C).</p>
<h3>Review of family assistance or social security decisions</h3>
<p>The Registrar is not required to communicate protected information to the AAT when it is reviewing a care determination made by the Secretary unless it is for the purposes of either of the child support Acts (CSRC Act section 16(5) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(5)).</span></p>
<p>The AAT may request information from the Registrar when it is reviewing a care determination made by the Secretary. The Registrar will provide the information to the AAT as the percentage of care will ultimately impact on the child support assessment.</p>
<p>The AAT may request information from the Registrar when it is reviewing a non-child support related matter, for example where the AAT is reviewing a decision relating to social security pensions, benefits or allowances. Whilst the Registrar is not required to comply with this request, this information will be provided because it is consistent with the Registrar's ability to release the same information to the Chief Executive Centrelink under CSRC Act section 16(3)(ba) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(3)(ba).</span></p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The AAT is reviewing a determination made by the Secretary rejecting a person's claim for <a href="../../acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a>. The person concerned has a child support assessment in place and the AAT is satisfied that the Registrar may have information that is relevant to the decision under review. If the AAT requests information from the Registrar, that request will be complied with if the information is in the Registrar's possession.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="six">Disclosure to Commonwealth investigating &amp; auditing agencies</h2>
<ul><li>Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman</li>
<li>Privacy Commissioner</li>
<li>Auditor-General or officers of the Australian National Audit Office</li>
<li>Department of Finance.</li>
</ul><p>These Commonwealth agencies are authorised by Parliament to investigate or audit the departmental processes and to make specific decisions for which they are responsible, and require the provision of information or documents. Services Australia can provide protected information to officers of these agencies because it is in the course of their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(2A) and CSA Act <span class="nobr">section 150(2A)).</span></p>
<h2 id="seven">Disclosure to the Minister</h2>
<p>Protected information can be used to brief a Minister for various purposes in relation to their responsibilities. A 'Minister' means the Minister for Social Services, who administers child support legislation, the Minister for Human Services, who has responsibility for Services Australia as the service delivery agency, and the Prime Minister (CSA Act section 150(4C) and CSRC Act <span class="nobr">section 16(4C)).</span></p>
<p>Specifically, protected information may be communicated to a Minister in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>so that the Minister can respond to complaints or issues raised with the Minister</li>
<li>in respect of a meeting or forum that the Minister is to attend</li>
<li>in relation to issues raised or proposed to be raised publicly (by or on behalf of the person to whom the information relates) so that the Minister can respond by correcting a mistake of fact, a misleading perception or impression, a misleading statement or an incorrectly held opinion</li>
<li>where it involves a possible error or delay on the part of the Registrar or an officer or employee of Services Australia, or</li>
<li>where it involves an instance of an anomalous or unusual operation of the child support legislation.</li>
</ul><h2 id="eight">Disclosure to persons with a 'sufficient interest'</h2>
<p>In certain circumstances (listed under the subheadings below) disclosures may be made to a person with a 'sufficient interest' in the protected information. The Registrar or a person authorised by the Registrar must be satisfied that, in relation to the purposes of the communication, the person has a genuine and legitimate interest in the information (CSA Act sections 150(4) and 150(4A) and CSRC Act sections 16(4) and 16(4A)). A Minister administering the child support legislation, a Minister responsible for the delivery of services under the legislation, or the Prime Minister, would have sufficient interest.</p>
<p>A further requirement which must be met (before information could be released in the circumstances outlined below) is that the information in question could not reasonably be obtained from a source other than Services Australia or DSS (CSA Act section 150(4)(a) and CSRC Act <span class="nobr">section 16(4)(a)).</span></p>
<h3>Mistake of fact &amp; integrity of the administration of the legislation</h3>
<p>Protected information is able to be communicated to correct a mistake of fact about the administration of the child support legislation, if the integrity of that administration would be at risk if the mistake were not corrected. See CSA Act section 150(4B) and CSRC Act <span class="nobr">section 16(4B).</span></p>
<h3>Missing persons</h3>
<p>Services Australia is able to communicate protected information where the information is about a missing person and there is no reasonable ground to believe the missing person would not want the information communicated and it is necessary:</p>
<ul><li>to assist a court, coronial enquiry, Royal Commission, department or authority, of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, in relation to the whereabouts of the missing person, or</li>
<li>to locate a person (including the missing person).</li>
</ul><p>See CSA Act section 150(4D) and CSRC Act section 16(4D).</p>
<h3>Deceased persons</h3>
<p>Services Australia can communicate protected information where the information is about a deceased person and there is no reasonable ground to believe that the deceased person would not have wanted the information communicated and:</p>
<ul><li>it is necessary to assist a court, coronial enquiry, Royal Commission, department or authority, of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, in relation to the death of a person</li>
<li>it is necessary to help a person locate a relative or beneficiary of the deceased person, or</li>
<li>it is in relation to the administration of the estate of the deceased person.</li>
</ul><p>See CSA Act section 150(4E) and CSRC Act 16(4E).</p>
<p>Services Australia may also communicate protected information if the information is to establish:</p>
<ul><li>the death of a person, or</li>
<li>the place where the death of a person is registered.</li>
</ul><p>See CSA Act section 150(4F) and CSRC Act section 16(4F).</p>
<h2 id="overseas">Disclosure to overseas authorities</h2>
<p>Services Australia can give protected information to an overseas authority if:</p>
<ul><li>a request from an overseas authority for information is received</li>
<li>the request is made in reliance on an international maintenance arrangement, and</li>
<li>it is necessary or convenient for the purposes of the international maintenance arrangement to give the information to the overseas authority.</li>
</ul><p>See CSRC Act section 121B.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> New Zealand Inland Revenue Child Support (NZIRCS) requests information from the Registrar about the income of a payer who is resident in Australia for the purpose of making a child support assessment in New Zealand. This request is made in reliance on the Australia and New Zealand Agreement (<a href="../../1/5/2">1.5.2</a>). It is necessary for the purposes of this agreement for the Registrar to provide the information. Services Australia can disclose this information to NZIRCS.</p>

<h1 >1.4.3 Application of the CSA Act to WA Ex-nuptial Cases</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CSA Act and its amendments apply to WA ex-nuptial cases to the extent that it has been adopted by the WA Parliament.</p>
<p>The WA Parliament has adopted the CSA Act and certain amendments made to this Act. The arrangement by which the WA Parliament has adopted these laws means that, from time to time, the Registrar must treat WA ex-nuptial cases differently to other cases.</p>

<h2>Commencement of the CSA Act</h2>
<p>The CSA Act came into operation on 1 October 1989. It did not apply to WA ex-nuptial children immediately. Carers of ex-nuptial children resident in WA could still apply to the WA Family Court for orders for child maintenance. The Registrar could register these court orders under the CSRC Act.</p>
<h2 id="adoption19jan91">WA adoption of CSA Act from 19 January 1991</h2>
<p>WA Parliament adopted the CSA Act from 19 January 1991. From that date the following arrangements applied to WA ex-nuptial cases:</p>
<ul><li>Ex-nuptial children living in WA are eligible children for the purposes of the CSA Act and the people who care for them are able to apply for an administrative assessment of child support.</li>
<li>Carers of WA ex-nuptial children can no longer apply to the court for variations to existing court orders and registered agreements. A carer in a WA ex-nuptial case could have a court order for maintenance and be entitled to apply for an administrative assessment of child support payable by the same payer for the same child. In these cases, the Registrar offsets the overlapping court orders (or agreements) and administrative assessments.</li>
</ul><div class="example">
<p><strong>Example: </strong>M and F are the parents of A. M and F separated on 1 December 1989. They were never married. A lives with M in Western Australia.</p>
<p>M applied to the Western Australian Family Court for an order requiring F to pay maintenance for A. The court ordered F to pay $25 per week. M registered the order with the Registrar and the Registrar started collecting child support from F.</p>
<p>M applied to the Registrar on 3 February 1991 for an administrative assessment of child support. The Registrar accepted M's application and worked out that F should pay $100 per week. M's court ordered amount remained as $25 per week and the assessment amount was reduced to $75 per week so that the overall amount payable (comprising both liabilities) was $100 per week.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="adoption9dec94">WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 9 December 1994</h2>
<p>The WA Parliament adopted amendments made to the CSA Act since the last adoption from 9 December 1994. From that date the following arrangements applied to WA ex-nuptial cases:</p>
<ul><li>Parents in a WA ex-nuptial case can apply to the Registrar for a change to their assessment in the special circumstances of the case for any child support year commencing 1 July 1992 onwards rather than applying to the court.</li>
<li>Payees in WA ex-nuptial cases who receive more than minimum family payment can no longer elect to end their child support assessments.</li>
<li>The Registrar no longer offsets overlapping liabilities for WA ex-nuptial cases. Instead, a court order for child support ceases to have effect when child support becomes payable under an administrative assessment for the child.</li>
<li>A person is considered an eligible carer of a WA ex-nuptial child if they cared for the child for at least 30% of the nights in the child support year.</li>
<li>If the payer or payee's taxable income for the last relevant year is not available when the Registrar is making a new child support assessment for a WA ex-nuptial case, the Registrar can choose an appropriate default income for that person. Before 9 December 1994, the Registrar was required to use a default income figure equivalent to 2.5 times average weekly earnings.</li>
<li>A payer or payee in a WA ex-nuptial case can no longer revoke their estimate of taxable income unless they make a new estimate election. Before 9 December 1994 a person could revoke their estimate and have their case return to the previous assessment based upon their income 2 years prior. Estimates could also be replaced by new estimates every 2 months rather than 3 months.</li>
<li>Courts are required to give reasons for making orders by consent for a change of assessment in special circumstances, or the provision of 'in kind' child support in cases where the payee in a WA ex-nuptial case received an income tested pension, benefit or allowance.</li>
</ul><h2 id="adoption30jun00">WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 30 June 2000</h2>
<p>The WA Parliament adopted further amendments to the CSA Act from 30 June 2000. From that date the following arrangements applied to WA ex-nuptial cases:</p>
<ul><li>The start date of the liability arising from acceptance of an application for an assessment in a WA ex-nuptial case is the date the application was lodged.</li>
<li>Payees in WA ex-nuptial cases can apply for the administrative assessment of child support for a child in secondary education to continue to the end of the school year in which the child turns 18.</li>
<li>Payers and payees in WA ex-nuptial cases can now provide information and make some applications over the telephone, which the Registrar previously required in writing.</li>
<li>The Registrar can now be satisfied that a person is a parent of a WA ex-nuptial child if:
<ul><li>the child is born within 44 weeks of a marriage being annulled, or</li>
<li>the child is born after a marriage has been dissolved but within 44 weeks after a period of cohabitation by the 2 people concerned, or</li>
<li>the child is born to a woman who lived with the man anytime during the period beginning 44 weeks and ending 20 weeks before the child's birth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Payers and payees in WA ex-nuptial cases can object to decisions of the Registrar under the CSA Act.</li>
<li>Payers and payees in WA ex-nuptial cases may only apply to a court for a departure from administrative assessment (section 116), or appeal against an incorrect assessment (section 110), or appeal against the acceptance or non-acceptance of a child support agreement (section 132) providing they have personally objected to the decision and it has been disallowed or partly allowed.</li>
<li>The Registrar can make a decision to either increase or decrease the amount of child support payable when making a change of assessment decision on an application by a payer or payee in a WA ex-nuptial case.</li>
<li>The Registrar can initiate a change of assessment in special circumstances for a WA ex-nuptial case.</li>
<li>A liable parent in a WA ex-nuptial case can apply for an administrative assessment.</li>
<li>The Registrar will include relevant dependent children in a child support assessment for a WA ex-nuptial case from the date of notification unless the Registrar is notified within 28 days of the child becoming a relevant dependent child, or within 28 days of a notice of assessment.</li>
<li>Changes to levels of care of a child in a WA ex-nuptial case will have effect from the date the Registrar is notified of the change.</li>
<li>Payees in WA ex-nuptial cases who receive more than the base rate of <a href="../../acronyms#ftb" title="Family tax benefit">FTB</a> Part A can elect to end their assessment if the Secretary approves the election. The Secretary must be satisfied that the payee is taking reasonable action to obtain maintenance for the child.</li>
<li>The Registrar must refer an agreement between the payer and payee in a WA ex-nuptial case, if the payee receives more than the base rate of FTB Part A, to the Secretary. The Registrar can only accept these agreements if the Secretary decides that the agreement passes the 'reasonable action to obtain maintenance' test.</li>
</ul><h2 id="adoption1jan01">WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 1 January 2001</h2>
<p>The following amendments applied to WA ex-nuptial cases from 1 January 2001:</p>
<ul><li>Child support for WA ex-nuptial cases is assessed in child support periods rather than child support years. A child support period may last up to 15 months.</li>
<li>The assessments are based on taxable income for the most recent taxation year rather than taxable income for the financial year before last.</li>
<li>The payee's disregarded income is based on the 'all employees average weekly earnings' figure rather than the usually higher average weekly earnings figure and extra amounts according to the age of the children were no longer added to it.</li>
<li>The payer's exempt income amount was increased to 110% of the unpartnered rate of social security pension relevant to the one payable for the child support period.</li>
<li>When the liable parent has relevant dependent children the exempt income amount is increased to 220% of the annual amount of the partnered rate of social security pension relevant to that payable for the child support period.</li>
<li>The minimum child support rate payable is $260, not nil, and will not be reduced below $260 per annum unless the person's total income in the first 12 months of a child support period is less than $260.</li>
<li>A payee can apply for a change of assessment if the child care costs they incur are high and cost more than 5% of their child support income amount.</li>
<li>The Registrar cannot make a decision on a change of assessment application that the annual rate of child support in a case is to be reduced to nil.</li>
<li>In calculating the amount payable in an assessment the payer's adjusted income is reduced by 50 cents for every dollar of the carer parent's income above the disregarded income amount.</li>
<li>Any supplementary income (exempt foreign income, net rental losses and reportable fringe benefits) is added back to the liable parent's taxable income amounts.</li>
<li>When the parents share care of the children of a relationship, additional amounts are added to the liable parent's exempt income for any children in their sole, major or shared care.</li>
<li>The Registrar may refuse, review or amend a payer or payee's estimate of income.</li>
</ul><h2 id="adoption1jan01">New child support assessments commencing 1 January 2001</h2>
<p>The Registrar made a new child support assessment for every WA ex-nuptial case, which applied to a child support period starting on 1 January 2001.</p>
<p>The Registrar based the new child support assessment upon the parents' taxable income for 1999-2000 if the <a href="../../acronyms#ato" title="Australian Taxation Office">ATO</a> had issued an assessment of taxable income for that year for either parent. If neither parent's 1999-2000 taxable income was available, the Registrar based the new assessment on the 1998-1999 taxable income for each parent inflated by the relevant child support inflation factor.</p>

<p>The following provisions of the CSA Act apply to WA ex-nuptial cases from 9 December 2002:</p>

<li>Either parent in WA ex-nuptial cases may now apply to a court for an order for departure from administrative assessment (<a href="../../4/3/2">4.3.2</a>) (section 116), or appeal against an incorrect assessment (section 110), or appeal against the acceptance or non-acceptance of a child support agreement (section 132) providing at least one of the parents has objected to the Registrar's decision and the Registrar has disallowed the objection or allowed it in whole or in part.</li>

<li>A court has increased powers to make orders staying a child support assessment or collection pending the determination of an objection, application for review, or appeal to a court.</li>
<li>The Registrar is unable to make change of assessment decisions that affect a period more than 18 months earlier than the date of the application unless the court has granted leave.

Those amendments, which apply to all other cases from 1 July 2008, are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Child support agreements lodged with the Registrar on or after 1 July 2008, which effect periods prior to 1 July 2008 as well as periods from 1 July 2008, will be treated as 2 separate child support agreements - one for the period prior to 1 July 2008 and the other for the period from 1 July 2008.</li>
</ul><p>Amendments to the CSA Act made by the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2008 apply to WA ex-nuptial cases from 3 March 2011. Those amendments, which apply to all other cases from 6 January 2009, are as follows:</p>
<p>Change in the percentage of care</p>
<ul><li>a change to a person's percentage of care will take effect from:
<ul><li>if the Registrar is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, of the event within 28 days after the day on which the event occurs - the day on which the event occurs,</li>
<li>in any other case - the day on which the Registrar is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, of the event,</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Applications for the minimum assessment to be reduced to nil</p>
<ul><li>a parent can make an application that:
<ul><li>nominates the whole of a child support period, or</li>
<li>a part of a child support period, being a part that is at least 2 months old and starts on a day on which they are assessed on the minimum annual rate,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>an application will be granted if the Registrar is satisfied the parent's annualised income, based on the income for the nominated period, will be less than the amount of the minimum annual rate multiplied by the total number of the parent's child support cases (section 66A(2)),</li>
<li>a parent's annualised income is the parent's income for the nominated period/Number of days in the nominated period × 365.</li>
</ul><p>Accepting an agreement during the change of assessment process</p>
<ul><li>an agreement is a limited child support agreement if accepted by the Registrar under section 98U without needing to meet the tests in 80E (2) to (5),</li>
<li>the Registrar must not accept the agreement unless satisfied that it would be just and equitable, as regards to the child, liable parent and carer entitled to child support, to accept the agreement.</li>
</ul><p>Change of assessment reason 6 - high costs of child care</p>
<ul><li>a payer or a non-parent carer can apply to have high child care costs considered during the change of assessment process,</li>
<li>child care costs for a non-parent carer can only be considered high if, during the child support period, they total at least 25% of the costs of the child for that period.</li>
</ul><p>Change of assessment in respect of a provisional notional assessment</p>
<ul><li>when an application is made for a change of assessment and a child support agreement is accepted during this process (98U), the application for a change of assessment is taken to be an application for a departure determination in respect of a provisional notional assessment (section 146D).</li>
</ul><p>There were other (care) amendments to the CSA Act made by the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2008 that will not apply to WA ex-nuptial cases.

<li>a change in care arrangements where the percentage of care for the child has increased to 35% or above,</li>

</ul><p>Amendments to the CSA Act made by the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws - General Law Reform) Act 2008 apply to WA ex-nuptial cases from 3 March 2011. Those amendments, which apply to all other cases from 1 July 2009, are as follows:</p>

<li>A new default income rule uses a parent's previous taxable income ATI, multiplied by the ATI indexation factor (<a href="../../2/4/2">2.4.2</a>), if that amount is greater than 2/3 of the male total average weekly earnings (MTAWE), when the parent has not lodged tax returns for the last relevant year of income, or the previous year.</li>

</ul><h2>WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 28 November 2015</h2>
<p>The amendment of the <cite>Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990</cite> (WA) by the <cite>Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Amendment Act 2015</cite> (WA) commenced on 28 November 2015. From that day, the amended Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA) adopted the amended CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, which included amendments to the CSA Act made by the <cite>Treasury Legislation Amendment (Repeal Day) Act 2015 </cite>and the <cite>Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015</cite>.</p>
<p>The amendment to the CSA Act made by the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Repeal Day) Act 2015 applies to cases involving WA ex-nuptial children from 28 November 2015. The amendment, which applies to all other cases from 1 July 2015, is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The definition of a resident of Australia was amended due to amendments to the definition of Australia under taxation legislation. This amendment to the CSA Act provides that the definition of a resident of Australia continues to exclude residents of the external territories for child support purposes.</li>
</ul><p>The Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015 merged the <a href="../../acronyms#aat" title="Administrative Appeals Tribunal">AAT</a>, the SSAT, Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal. The amalgamated tribunal is called the AAT. The amendments to the CSA Act made by the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015 apply to cases involving WA ex-nuptial children from 28 November 2015. The amendments, which apply to all other cases from 1 July 2015, include:</p>

<li>Amendments to enable persons to seek merits review where the Child Support Registrar has refused to make a departure determination under sections 98E or 98R of the CSA Act because the issues are too complex, whereas under the previous policy they were required to seek an outcome in the courts,</li>
<li>Consequential amendments to replace references to the SSAT with references to the AAT.</li>
</ul><h2>CSA Act provisions which do not apply to WA ex-nuptial cases</h2>
<p>On 31 July 2015, section 4AA of the <cite>Crimes Act 1914</cite> was amended by the <cite>Crimes Legislation Amendment (Penalty Unit) Act 2015</cite> to increase the penalty unit amount to $180. Due to amendments made by the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Amendment Act 2015 (WA), the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA) has adopted the amended CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2015. Therefore, the penalty unit amount remains at $170 for WA ex-nuptial cases because this was the penalty unit that applied on 1 July 2015.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2016, the meaning of 'resident of Australia' in the CSA Act was amended by the <cite>Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015</cite>. This amendment provided that residents of Norfolk Island are residents of Australia for child support purposes, and enables residents of Norfolk Island to apply for child support. As this amendment occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, the definition of a 'resident of Australia' in section 10 of the CSA Act that is to apply to WA ex-nuptial cases will continue to exclude Norfolk Island residents as residents of Australia for child support purposes.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2016, the meaning of 'resident of Australia' in the CSA Act was further amended by the <cite>Territories Legislation Amendment Act 2016</cite>. This amendment provided that residents of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are residents of Australia for child support purposes, and enables these residents to apply for child support. As this amendment occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, the meaning of 'resident of Australia' in section 10 of the CSA Act that is to apply to WA ex-nuptial cases will continue to exclude residents of Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands for child support purposes.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2017, section 4AA of the Crimes Act was amended by the <cite>Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Act 2017</cite> to increase the 'penalty unit' amount to $210, and for this amount to be automatically indexed in line with changes in the CPI on 1 July 2020 and each third 1 July following that day. As this amendment occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2015, the penalty unit amount remains at $170 for WA ex‑nuptial cases.</p>

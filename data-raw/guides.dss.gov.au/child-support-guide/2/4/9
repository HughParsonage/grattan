<h1 >2.4.9 Assessments when a parent has multiple child support cases (Formulas 3 &amp; 4)</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Formula 3 is used to calculate the child support assessment when 1 or both parents have more than 1 child support case.</p>
<p>If somebody other than a parent is providing some care for a child and 1 or both parents have multiple child support cases then Formula 4 is used to calculate the assessment for that case.</p>
<div class="reference">
<h2>Act references</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03872" title="Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989">CSA Act</a> section 7B, section 36 to section 38, section 41, section 42, section 46 to section 48, section 55A to section 55E, section 55HA, section 156</p>
</div>
<h2>On this page</h2>
<p>Parents can have more than 1 child support case, that is, they can have children from different relationships in child support assessments with more than 1 other parent. To recognise a parent's responsibility to support their children in another child support case, 1 of the following mechanisms will be used to calculate child support assessments for parents with multiple child support cases:</p>
<ul><li>the <a href="9#mcallow">multi-case allowance</a>, which is deducted from a parent's adjusted taxable income to reach their child support income at step 1 of the basic formula (section 47), or</li>
<li>the <a href="9#mccap">multi-case cap</a>, which is a separate calculation for the paying parent worked out at step 8 (section 55E).</li>
</ul><p>For each child, a child support amount will be worked out using each of these 2 mechanisms, and the lesser of the 2 amounts will be the assessed rate of child support. Only 1 mechanism functions at a time - either the child support is worked out using the income after the deduction of the multi-case allowance, or the child support is worked out according to the multi-case cap on child support.</p>
<ul><li><a href="9#mccosts">Multi-case child costs</a></li>
<li><a href="9#mcallow">Multi-case allowance</a></li>
<li><a href="9#mccap">Multi-case cap</a></li>
<li><a href="9#mcallorcap">Multi-case allowance or multi-case cap</a></li>
<li><a href="9#formula3">Formula 3 - Parents in multiple child support cases</a></li>
<li><a href="9#formula4">Formula 4 - Multiple child support cases with a non-parent carer</a></li>
<li><a href="9#sharemoney">When child support is payable by or to more than 1 person under Formula 4</a></li>
</ul><h2 id="mccosts">Multi-case child costs</h2>
<p>Both the multi-case cap and the multi-case allowance are calculated using the multi-case costs of the children.</p>
<p>The multi-case costs of a child are what it would cost the parent to support the child if all of the parent's child support children lived with them full-time, based on that parent's income.</p>
<p>When calculating the multi-case costs, use the parent's adjusted taxable income for the child support case, less the self-support amount and less the relevant dependent child amount (where appropriate).</p>
<p>The multi-case cost of each child is calculated as if all the child support children were the same age as that child. To work out this cost:</p>
<ul><li>work out the total number of the parent's child support children</li>
<li>look up the parent's (individual) income and the age of the child on the relevant Costs of the Children Table (<a href="2">2.4.2</a>) to find what all the children would cost if they were all the same age</li>
<li>divide this amount by the total number of the parent's child support children.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> 'The parent's child support children' are all of the children currently in the child support assessments of the parent for whom you are calculating the multi-case costs.</p>
<p>The approach used to calculate the multi-case costs of a child, although similar, differs from the multiple case method (<a href="6">2.4.6</a>) of calculating the costs of a child. This is because the multi-case costs recognise a parent's responsibility for all their children in all their child support cases, whereas the multiple case method calculates a parent's child support responsibility for the child or children in a case.</p>
<div class="example">
<p id="mcccexample"><strong>Example:</strong> Jonah has an initial child support income of $20,000 (the adjusted taxable income less the self-support amount). Jonah and Sian have 2 children, Koby aged 14 and Ryan aged 10. Jonah has another child support case with Winfried for child Bran, aged 5. The multi-case child costs for Koby and Ryan would be:</p>
<p>Costs of Koby (14 years old)<br />
		= $20,000 × $0.32 (3+ children aged 13+ years from the Costs of the Children tables)<br />
		= $6,400 ÷ 3 (divide by number of all child support children)<br />
		= $2,133</p>
<p>Costs of Ryan (10 years old)<br />
		= $20,000 × $0.27 (3+ children aged 0 - 12 years from the Costs of the Children tables)<br />
		= $5,400 ÷ 3 (divide by number of all child support children)<br />
		= $1,800</p>
</div>
<h2 id="mcallow">Multi-case allowance</h2>
<p>The multi-case allowance is an allowance deducted from a parent's adjusted taxable income to recognise a parent's responsibility for child support for their children in another child support case (section 47).</p>
<p>The multi-case allowance is the sum of the <a href="9#mccosts">multi-case child costs</a>, excluding the costs of the children of the case to which the assessment relates. That is, the parent has an amount deducted from their income to recognise the costs of supporting the children in their other case or cases. The amount deducted is the total of the multi-case costs of those other children.</p>
<div class="example">
<p id="mcexample"><strong>Example:</strong> Julie has children from 3 relationships. Julie and Charlton have 2 children, Jesse and Kevin. Julie and Josef have 1 child, Patricia. Josef also has an assessment with Hildegard for their children, Debi and Raul. Julie and Ruben have 2 children, Reginald and Jaron.</p>
<p>In calculating Julie's child support income for the assessment for Jesse and Kevin, the multi-case allowance is the sum of the multi-case costs of Patricia, Reginald and Jaron.</p>
<p>In calculating Julie's child support income for the assessment for Patricia, the multi-case allowance is the sum of the multi-case costs of Jesse, Kevin, Reginald and Jaron. Josef will also have a multi-case allowance, being the multi-case costs of Debi and Raul.</p>
<p>In calculating Julie's child support income for the assessment for Reginald and Jaron, the multi-case allowance is the sum of the multi-case costs of Jesse, Kevin and Patricia.</p>
</div>
<p>A parent can meet the costs of each child by paying child support, by directly caring for the child or by a combination of the 2. The multi-case allowance recognises the costs of a child in another case, not the amount of child support payable.</p>
<p>The multi-case allowance is rounded to the nearest dollar (section 156).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Sam has an initial child support income of $20,000 (the adjusted taxable income less the self-support amount). Sam has no relevant dependent children. Sam and Marisol have 2 children, Moses aged 14 and Adel aged 10. Sam has another child support case with Hiawatha for child Augustine, aged 5. In calculating the assessment for Augustine, the multi-case allowance for Moses and Adel is the total of the multi-case costs for Moses and Adel. The costs are as calculated in the example <a href="9#mcccexample">above</a>.</p>
<p>Child support income for Sam</p>
<p>Multi-case allowance = multi-case costs of Moses + Adel<br />
		= $2,133 + $1,800<br />
		= $3,933</p>
<p>Initial child support income less the multi-case allowance<br />
		= $20,000 − $3,933<br />
		= $16,067</p>
</div>
<h2 id="mccap">Multi-case cap</h2>
<p>The multi-case cap is used to ensure that the paying parent does not pay more child support for a child than they would if all the children lived in the same household. The cap recognises that the parent may be bearing some of the costs of a child directly through regular or shared care, and is adjusted accordingly. The cap is calculated on a per child basis.</p>
<p>The multi-case cap for each child is the multi-case child costs for the child, multiplied by the costs that the parent does not meet directly through care (100% less their cost percentage) (section 55E). That is:<br />
	(100% − cost percentage) × multi-case child costs.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If Edward has regular care of child Irene, and therefore a cost percentage of 24% for Irene, and Irene's multi-case child cost is $1,800, then:</p>
<p>Multi-case cap = (100% − 24%) × $1,800<br />
		= 76% × $1,800 = $1,368</p>
</div>
<h2 id="mcallorcap">Multi-case allowance or multi-case cap</h2>
<p>The multi-case allowance recognises a parent's responsibility to their other child support children by using an income shares approach. The multi-case cap ensures a parent does not pay more for a child than they would if all children were living in the 1 household. Both the cap and the allowance are methods of recognising the parent's other obligations, so only 1 method is needed at any one time.</p>
<p>Only 1 method will be used to determine the child support amount payable for each child, i.e. either the child support amount is worked out using the income after the deduction of the multi-case allowance, or the child support is worked out according to the multi-case cap. For each child, the lesser of the 2 amounts calculated will be the assessed rate of child support.</p>
<h2 id="formula3">Formula 3 - Parents in multiple child support cases</h2>
<p>This formula is used to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child when 1 or both of the parents have at least 1 other case, and there is no non-parent carer (section 37).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Work out each parent's child support income (<a href="7">2.4.7</a>) (section 41), by using the following formula:</p>
<ul><li>parent's adjusted taxable income in that child support case</li>
<li>less the self-support amount</li>
<li>less the parent's relevant dependent child amount (if applicable)</li>
<li>less the parent's multi-case allowance for the child.</li>
</ul><p>Where a parent has more than 1 child support case, their child support income needs to be calculated separately for each case, as the parent's adjusted taxable income and multi-case allowance may differ across their child support cases.</p>
<p>First, take the parent's adjusted taxable income applicable to that child support case and deduct the self-support amount.</p>
<p>Second, if applicable, work out a relevant dependent child (<a href="6">2.4.6</a>) amount (section 46), and deduct the relevant dependent child amount from the amount above.</p>
<p>Third, if the parent has more than 1 child support case, work out the parent's multi-case allowance (section 47) and deduct the multi-case allowance from the amount above.</p>
<p>The final result is the parent's child support income for that case.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Work out the parents' combined child support income (<a href="7">2.4.7</a>) (section 42).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Work out each parent's income percentage (<a href="7">2.4.7</a>) (section 55B).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Work out each parent's percentage of care (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the child (section 48).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Work out each parent's cost percentage (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the child (section 55C).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Work out each parent's child support percentage (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the child (section 55D).</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Work out the costs of the child (<a href="6">2.4.6</a>) for the day under section 55HA, calculating the costs for older and younger children separately.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for the child is worked out using the formula:<br />

<p>The outcome of step 8 will be the child support payable if the parent assessed to pay child support does not have more than 1 child support case.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9 (if applicable):</strong> If a parent has more than 1 child support case and a positive child support percentage under step 6, calculate the multi-case cap for that parent (section 55E):<br />

<h2 id="formula4">Formula 4 - Multiple child support cases with a non-parent carer</h2>
<p>This formula is used to work out the annual rate of child support payable for a child when 1 or both of the parents have at least 1 other case, and 1 or more non-parent carers has at least 35% care of a child (section 38).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Work out each parent's child support income (<a href="7">2.4.7</a>) (section 41), by using the following formula:</p>
<ul><li>Parent's adjusted taxable income in that child support case,</li>
<li>less the self-support amount,</li>
<li>less the parent's relevant dependent child amount (if applicable),</li>
<li>less the parent's multi-case allowance for the child.</li>
</ul><p>Where a parent has more than 1 child support case, their child support income needs to be calculated separately for each case, as the parent's adjusted taxable income and multi-case allowance may differ across their child support cases.</p>
<p>First, take the parent's adjusted taxable income applicable to that child support case and deduct the self-support amount.</p>
<p>Second, if applicable, work out a relevant dependent child (<a href="6">2.4.6</a>) amount (section 46), and deduct the relevant dependent child amount from the amount above.</p>
<p>Third, if the parent has more than 1 child support case, work out the parent's multi-case allowance (section 47) and deduct the multi-case allowance from the amount above.</p>
<p>The final result is the parent's child support income for that case.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Work out the parents' combined child support income (<a href="7">2.4.7</a>) (section 42).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Work out each parent's income percentage (<a href="7">2.4.7</a>) (section 55B).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Work out each parent's and non-parent carer's percentage of care (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the child (section 48).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Work out each parent's and non-parent carer's cost percentage (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the child (section 55C).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Work out each parent's child support percentage (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the child (section 55D).</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Work out the costs of the child (<a href="6">2.4.6</a>) for the day under section 55HA, calculating the costs for older and younger children separately.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: If a parent has a positive child support percentage under step 6, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent for the child for the day is worked out using the formula:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Child support percentage × cost of the child</p>
<p>The outcome of step 8 will be the child support payable if the parent assessed to pay child support does not have more than 1 child support case.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9 (if applicable)</strong>: If a parent has more than 1 child support case and a positive child support percentage under step 6, calculate the multi-case cap for that parent (section 55E):</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Multi-case cap = (100% − parent's cost percentage (<a href="5">2.4.5</a>) for the particular child) × multi-case child costs for the particular child</p>
<p>The child support payable is the lower of the annual rate calculated at step 8, or the multi-case cap calculated at step 9.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>A non-parent carer is not entitled to be paid child support unless they have at least 35% care of the child (section 7B) and they have applied under section 25A (section 40B). If more than 1 non-parent carer is entitled to receive child support from a parent or both parents, then their share of the entitlement is determined in accordance with section 40A. See <a href="8">2.4.8</a> for information about the calculations required when child support is payable to more than 1 person.</p>
<p>Different rules apply if the minimum annual rate of child support is payable to more than 1 person. See <a href="12">2.4.12</a> for details of the rules that apply, which depend upon the level of care provided by the carer.</p>

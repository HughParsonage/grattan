## Introduction
This vignette uses a [recent op-ed](https://grattan.edu.au/news/young-australians-will-wear-the-costs-of-turnbulls-middle-income-tax-cut/) to demonstrate several tools within the `grattan` package:

1. projection of sample files for analysis over the budget forward estimates, including a flexible assumption about future wage growth
2. calculating income tax, both under present settings and changes to thresholds or rates.

### Average change of tax rates by decile
Say we want to compare the expected income tax paid by individuals in 2016-17 vs 2020-21.
We have 2\% sample files from 2012-13 and 2013-14.
To do distributional analysis for years beyond 2013-14, we `project` a sample file as many years ahead as required.
So for 2016-17, we use `project` with `h = 4L`. 
(The `h` stands for ''horizon''. 
The `L` means 'integer' in R: `project` insists that the `h` value is strictly an integer as that is the only type of value that makes sense here.)

```{r sample_file_1617}
sample_file_1617 <-
  project(sample_file_1213,
          h = 4L,
          fy.year.of.sample.file = "2012-13")
```

and similarly for 2020-21 we use `h = 8L`:

```{r sample_file_2021}
sample_file_2021 <-
  project(sample_file_1213,
          h = 8L,
          fy.year.of.sample.file = "2012-13")
```

I use `fy.year.of.sample.file = "2012-13"` rather than `= "2013-14"` as the former seems to give more accurate forecasts when compared with final budget outcomes in the years that follow.


The next step is to calculate the tax paid for each entry in the sample file for those years.
The `grattan` package provides `income_tax` for this purpose, with the optional argument `.dots.ATO` accepting a sample file to take care of the variables that are needed for the complex calculations of offsets and the Medicare levy.
The argument `fy.year` specifies what tax scales to use; for future years, we assume the current settings, unless the Government has announced changes in a future year, such as the expected increase to the Medicare levy.
Since the `income_tax` function only currently works for years as far ahead as 2019-20, we use that year for the 2020-21 projection of the sample file.

```{r add-tax-paid-avg-tax}
sample_file_1617[, tax_paid := income_tax(Taxable_Income,
                                          .dots.ATO = copy(sample_file_1617),
                                          fy.year = "2016-17")]
sample_file_1617[, avg_tax := tax_paid / Taxable_Income]
sample_file_2021[, tax_paid := income_tax(Taxable_Income,
                                          .dots.ATO = copy(sample_file_2021),
                                          fy.year = "2019-20")]
sample_file_2021[, avg_tax := tax_paid / Taxable_Income]
```

To calculate the average (average) tax by decile, we use `weighted_ntile` with the optional arguments `weights` left to the default (as the sample file is equiweighted).


```{r avg_tax_by_decile}
avg_tax_by_decile_1617 <- 
  sample_file_1617 %>%
  .[, .(avg_tax = mean(avg_tax)),
    keyby = .(decile = weighted_ntile(Taxable_Income, n = 10))]

avg_tax_by_decile_2021 <- 
  sample_file_2021 %>%
  .[, .(avg_tax = mean(avg_tax)),
    keyby = .(decile = weighted_ntile(Taxable_Income, n = 10))]
```


We can then plot a comparison of these table by joining them and using `ggplot2`. 
Since the tables are already keyed by `decile`, we can use the `X[Y]` method from `data.table` to join by `decile`.
This creates a three-column table: the first is `decile`, the second is `avg_tax` which is the `avg_tax` from the 2016-17 table and `i.avg_tax` which is the `avg_tax` from the 2020-21 table.
(In the result of `X[Y]`, any column in `Y` which has the same name as a column in `X` (but isn't a key) is prefixed with `i.` to distinguish it.)
We discard the lowest decile as the average tax is `NaN` for those with zero taxable income. 
Lastly, for cosmetic reasons, we convert `decile` to a factor so that the labels on the chart are `1, 2, 3, ...` rather than `0, 2.5, 5, ...`.

```{r tax-changes-grattan-forecast}
avg_tax_by_decile_1617[avg_tax_by_decile_2021] %>%
  .[decile > 1] %>%
  .[, ppt_increase := 100*(i.avg_tax - avg_tax)] %>%
  .[, decile := factor(decile)] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = decile, y = ppt_increase)) + 
  geom_col()
```

This chart and the underlying data are a reflection of the assumptions in the `project` function.
In particular, the `project` function uses a particular forecast of the wage price index to uprate the salary column in the sample file. 
This differs from the assumptions in the 2017 Budget. 

```{r Budget_wage_series}
Budget_wage_series <-
  data.table(fy_year = c("2017-18", "2018-19", "2019-20", "2020-21"),
             r = c(0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.0375))

kable(Budget_wage_series)
```

The `project` function expects wages to grow by `r percent(wage_inflator(from_fy = "2016-17", to_fy = "2020-21") - 1)` over the period 2016-17 to 2020-21, whereas
by the forecast in the Budget this number would be `r percent(wage_inflator(from_fy = "2016-17", to_fy = "2020-21", forecast.series = "custom", wage.series = Budget_wage_series) - 1)`.
Whatever the merits of each forecast, the `project` function allows you to specify a particular wage series in the future through the argument `wage.series =`.
We can then repeat the analysis above using those estimates:

```{r project-with-respect-to-budget}
sample_file_1617 <- project(sample_file_1213,
                            h = 4L,
                            fy.year.of.sample.file = "2012-13")

sample_file_2021 <- project(sample_file_1213,
                            fy.year.of.sample.file = "2012-13",
                            h = 8L,
                            wage.series = Budget_wage_series)

sample_file_1617[, tax_paid := income_tax(Taxable_Income,
                                          .dots.ATO = copy(sample_file_1617),
                                          fy.year = "2016-17")]
sample_file_1617[, avg_tax := tax_paid / Taxable_Income]
sample_file_2021[, tax_paid := income_tax(Taxable_Income,
                                          .dots.ATO = copy(sample_file_2021),
                                          fy.year = "2019-20")]
sample_file_2021[, avg_tax := tax_paid / Taxable_Income]

avg_tax_by_decile_1617 <- 
  sample_file_1617 %>%
  .[, .(avg_tax = mean(avg_tax)),
    keyby = .(decile = weighted_ntile(Taxable_Income, n = 10))]

avg_tax_by_decile_2021 <- 
  sample_file_2021 %>%
  .[, .(avg_tax = mean(avg_tax)),
    keyby = .(decile = weighted_ntile(Taxable_Income, n = 10))]

difference_2021_Budget <-
  avg_tax_by_decile_1617[avg_tax_by_decile_2021] %>%
  .[decile > 1] %>%
  .[, ppt_increase := 100*(i.avg_tax - avg_tax)]

difference_2021_Budget %>%
  copy %>%
  .[, decile := factor(decile)] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = decile, y = ppt_increase)) + 
  geom_col()
```

Through some intermediate calculations, we can obtain the sentence that was used in the op-ed:

```{r middle_income_avg_inc}
middle_income_avg_inc <-
  difference_2021_Budget %>%
  .[decile %between% c(3, 7)] %$%
  range(round(ppt_increase, 1))
```

```{r percentile_50000}
sample_file_1617[, percentile := weighted_ntile(Taxable_Income, n = 100)]
stopifnot(56 %in% sample_file_1617[Taxable_Income %between% c(49500, 50500)][["percentile"]])

avg_tax_rate_2017_50k <- 
  sample_file_1617[percentile == 56] %$% 
  mean(avg_tax) %>%
  round(3)

avg_tax_rate_2021_50k <- 
  sample_file_2021 %>%
  .[, percentile := weighted_ntile(Taxable_Income, n = 100)] %>%
  .[percentile == 56] %$% 
  mean(avg_tax) %>%
  round(3)
```

> Middle-income earners are particularly hurt by bracket creep. Based on the wages growth projected in the 2016 budget, the average tax rates for people in middle-income groups will increase by between `r middle_income_avg_inc[1]` and `r middle_income_avg_inc[2]` percentage points by 2021. 
For example, a person earning \$50,000 a year will go from paying an average tax rate of `r avg_tax_rate_2017_50k * 100` per cent in 2017 to `r avg_tax_rate_2021_50k * 100` per cent in 2021.

### Income tax with changes to rates
We can also use the package to estimate the revenue difference under changes to the marginal tax rates.
The following function accepts two arguments: the bracket number to modified, and a rate increase to that bracket.
The function returns the change in revenue (as a loss).


```{r Change_1ppt_2021}
tax_delta <- function(bracket_number, rate_increase = -0.01) {
  current_tax <-
    sample_file_2021[, .(tax = sum(tax_paid), 
                         WEIGHT = WEIGHT[1])] %$% 
    sum(tax * WEIGHT)
  
  orig_rates <- c(0, 0.19, 0.325, 0.37, 0.45)
  new_rates <- orig_rates
  new_rates[bracket_number] <- new_rates[bracket_number] + rate_increase
    
  # rebate_income is an internal function
  .ri <- grattan:::rebate_income
  
  new_tax <- 
    sample_file_2021 %>%
    copy %>%
    .[, base_tax. := IncomeTax(Taxable_Income,
                              thresholds = c(0, 18200, 37000, 87000, 180e3),
                              rates = new_rates)] %>%
    .[, medicare_levy. := medicare_levy(income = Taxable_Income, fy.year = "2019-20",
                                       Spouse_income = Spouse_adjusted_taxable_inc,
                                       sapto.eligible = (age_range <= 1),
                                       family_status = if_else(Spouse_adjusted_taxable_inc > 0, "family", "individual"))] %>%
    .[, lito. := lito(Taxable_Income, max_lito = 445, lito_taper = 0.015, min_bracket = 37000)] %>%
    .[, rebate_income := .ri(Taxable_Income,
                             Rptbl_Empr_spr_cont_amt = Rptbl_Empr_spr_cont_amt,
                             Net_fincl_invstmt_lss_amt = Net_fincl_invstmt_lss_amt,
                             Net_rent_amt = Net_rent_amt,
                             Rep_frng_ben_amt = Rep_frng_ben_amt)] %>%
    .[, sapto. := sapto(rebate_income, fy.year = "2019-20", sapto.eligible = (age_range <= 1))] %>%
    .[, tax_payable := pmaxC(base_tax. - lito. - sapto., 0) + medicare_levy.] %>%
    .[, .(tax = sum(tax_payable), 
          WEIGHT = WEIGHT[1])] %$% 
    sum(tax * WEIGHT)
  
  current_tax - new_tax
}
```

which leads to the sentence and table in the op-ed:

> For example, if the government was to reduce the tax rate only in the middle (37,000-87,000) bracket from 32.5\% to 30\%, the promised \$7.8 billion surplus in 2021 would all but be swallowed up by the `r round(tax_delta(3, -0.025) / 1e9, 1)` bn revenue loss.

```{r table_1pt}
data.table(tax_bracket = c("<18,200",
                           "18,200-37,000",
                           "37,000-87,000",
                           "87,000-180,000",
                           "180,000+"),
           budget_impact = c(NA, round(vapply(2:5, tax_delta, FUN.VALUE = double(1)) / 1e9, 2))) %>%
  kable
```


# Companion to the 2013-14 sample file

## Prologue
This vignette is a mirror of a small book prepared internally by Grattan Institute. The goal is to demonstrate how to perform simple analysis and create common charts. You will need the `taxstats` package available via `devtools::install_github('hughparsonage/taxstats')`.

```{r knitrOpts-sample-file}
options("scipen" = 99)

There were `r texNum(sum(sample_file$WEIGHT), sig.figs = 3L)` taxpayers in `r FY.YEAR` in Australia. Of those, `r texNum(sum(sample_file[Taxable_Income == 0]$WEIGHT))` had zero taxable income (or a taxable loss). (... and so these ''taxpayers'' naturally paid no tax. Nor did the `r texNum(sum(sample_file[Taxable_Income < 18200]$WEIGHT), sig.figs = 2)` individuals below the tax-free threshold. For this vignette, a *taxpayer* is anyone who lodged a tax return, regardless of their tax liability).

The capital gains discount applies to assets sold after more than 12 months' holding. There were `r texNum(n_CGs)` individuals who sold capital assets, up `r latex_percent(n_CGs/n_CGs_prev - 1)` from last year.

The tax on these capital gains totalled `r texNum(tax_on_CG$total, dollar = TRUE)` or `r texNum(tax_on_CG$avg, dollar = TRUE)` per individual with capital gains tax.

Taxable capital gains are typically realized later in life. This is unsurprising: a capital gain can only be realized when one has an asset to sell. Further, the capital gains tax makes the sale of assets less attractive when incomes are high.   Taxpayers in their twenties have a `r latex_percent(probCG_twenties)` chance of incurring capital gains tax, whereas `r latex_percent(probCG_65p)` of those of retirement age have capital gains.\footnote{Noting, of course, that the common denominator is \emph{taxpayers}. Since fewer retirees lodge individual tax returns than do those in their twenties, the difference in actual population incidence will be more moderate.} \Vref{fig:CG-Incidence-FY} shows that although capital gains have been more common with older taxpayers, the age skew  is slightly more pronounced in `r FY.YEAR` than in previous years. 

The average marginal tax rate of those with capital gains tax was `r latex_percent(avg_marginal_rate_CG)`; however, this weights an individual with a capital gain of \$1 equally as someone with a capital gain of \$500,000. Weighting by the value of capital gain, the average marginal tax rate was `r latex_percent(avg_marginal_rate_CG_weighted_by_CG)`.

The net capital gains includes the CGT discount (and other discounts) applied to:
$$\text{Total capital gains} - \text{Total capital losses (incl. from prev. years)}$$
Comparing the ratio \textit{Total capital gains} of \textit{Net capital gains} can shed some light on the value of the discount and the impact of capital losses on tax and tax revenue. Of those with nonzero total capital gains, `r latex_percent(prop_no_CGT_discount)` had no discount and `r latex_percent(prop_100pc_CGT_discount)` paid no tax (or a 100\%\ discount). Some `r latex_percent(prop_50pc_CGT_discount)` had net capital gains of around 50\%\ of their total gains. Weighting these numbers by the value of total capital gains,
`r latex_percent(prop_no_CGT_discount_by_val)` of capital gains are taxed at the full marginal rate.
\Vref{fig:CGT-discount-distribution} shows the distribution of this ratio. The deviance from 50\%\ is due to some gains being realized within 12 months and  (more commonly) capital losses.

# Differential uprating



Since the most recent versions of data detailing population income and wealth (as is contained within the ATO's sample files) is typically years out-of-date on release, even understanding the present requires a forecast. 
Since most variables relating to income increase due to inflation -- so any sensible forecast will increase the values relative to the past -- this procedure is often called **uprating**.

## Basic uprating

The most basic uprate method is the identity function, where the variables are not changed.

Alternatively, the variables can be increased by a long-term inflation rate. 
Even better, we can use the relevant time series indices for the variables and inflate using that index. 
For instance, salary and wage variables can be increased by the observed increase in the wage price index amd growth in the population of taxpayers by the labour force index.

## Differential uprating

Basic uprating suffers some limitations. 
There are significant structural differences in how much individuals' incomes grow. 
High-income individuals tend to have higher than average wage growth. 
Low-income individuals also have higher than average wage growth. 
That is, the pattern of wage growth by wage is U-shaped.

differential_uprates %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Salary percentile`, y = avg_r)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = percent)
```


**Differential uprating** is a method by which variables are uprated by a function of not only the time period and the type of variable, but of the variable's value too. To differentially uprate salary, use `differentially_uprate_wage`:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data_frame(wage = c(20e3, 50e3, 100e3)) %>%
  mutate(ordinary = wage_inflator(wage, from_fy = "2012-13", to_fy = "2013-14"), 
         `change ordinary` = ordinary / wage - 1, 
         differential = differentially_uprate_wage(wage, from_fy = "2012-13", to_fy = "2013-14"), 
         `change differential` = differential / wage - 1
         ) %>%
  mutate(wage = dollar(wage),
         ordinary = dollar(ordinary), 
         differential = dollar(differential), 
         `change ordinary` = percent(`change ordinary`), 
         `change differential` = percent(`change differential`)) %>%
  kable(align = rep("r", ncol(.)))
```


Note that `differentially_update_wage` uses the 2003-04 to 2013-14 sample files to generate estimates of the shape of the U. So applying the function to any other vector may have surprising results. In particular, the distribution of the vector provided is not considered. Furthermore, the `from_fy` must be in the range `2003-04` to `2013-14`.


# Modelling superannuation changes

## Introduction
Australia's superannuation system offers a number of tax breaks. Relative to most methods of savings, less tax is paid on money contributed to a super fund, and less tax is paid on the earnings. The functions described here attempt to model changes to tax breaks on money contributed to a super fund.

## Modelling

### The basic functions
The two tax methods modelled are **Superannuation contributions tax concessions** and **Division 293 tax**. The two main outputs are: the extra tax payable by a particular individual (and the symmetric extra revenue), and the number of individuals affected.

To obtain these results (say for 2017-18)

```{r}
library(grattan)
library(data.table)
if (requireNamespace("taxstats", quietly = TRUE)){
  library(taxstats)
  sample_files_all <- get_sample_files_all()
} else {
  templib <- tempfile()
  hutils::provide.dir(templib)
  install.packages("taxstats",
                   lib = templib,
                   repos = "https://hughparsonage.github.io/drat/",
                   type = "source")
  library("taxstats", lib.loc = templib)
  sample_files_all <- get_sample_files_all()
}
library(magrittr)
#' dollar scales
#' 
#' @name grattan_dollar
#' @param x A numeric vector
#' @param digits Minimum number of digits after the decimal point. (\code{nsmall} in \code{base::format}).
#' @details Makes negative numbers appear as \eqn{-\$10,000} instead of \eqn{\$-10,000} in \code{scales::dollar}.
#' @export
# from scales

grattan_dollar <- function (x, digits = 0) {
  #
  nsmall <- digits
  commaz <- format(abs(x), nsmall = nsmall, trim = TRUE, big.mark = ",", 
                   scientific = FALSE, digits = 1L)
  
  hutils::if_else(x < 0, 
          paste0("\U2212","$", commaz),
          paste0("$", commaz))
}

(new_revenue <- 
  sample_file_1314 %>%
  project_to(to_fy = "2017-18") %>%
  as.data.table %>%
  revenue_from_new_cap_and_div293(new_cap = 25e3, fy.year = "2016-17", new_age_based_cap = FALSE, new_div293_threshold = 250e3))

paste(grattan_dollar(new_revenue / 1e9), "bn")

(n_affected <-
  sample_file_1314 %>%
  project_to(to_fy = "2017-18") %>%
  as.data.table %>%
  n_affected_from_new_cap_and_div293(new_cap = 25e3, fy.year = "2016-17", new_age_based_cap = FALSE, new_div293_threshold = 250e3))

prettyNum(round(n_affected), big.mark = ",")
```

Notes: 

  1. `fy.year` refers to the year the function takes the tax scales from, not the forecast year. Because we don't have tax scales for 2017-18 yet, we model using the most recent (`2017-18`).
  2. The functions require their inputs to be `data.table`s. Sorry if you don't like `data.table`s.
  3. You must use `sample_file_1314` (because they have superannuation contributions variables).

### Distributional analysis

#### By taxable income decile
Let's create an object for `sample_file_1718` avoid recreating it every time:
```{r}
sample_file_1718 <-
  sample_file_1314 %>%
  project_to(to_fy = "2017-18") %>%
  as.data.table
```

The functions mentioned earlier return single values. In contrast, `model_new_caps_and_div293` returns the sample file with extra variables, which can then be analyzed as a standard sample file. The variables of note are `prv_revenue` which is the tax payable under the old system, and `new_revenue` which is the tax payable under the proposed system. Thus:

```{r}
new_sample_file_1718 <- 
  sample_file_1718 %>%
  model_new_caps_and_div293(new_cap = 25e3, fy.year = "2016-17", new_age_based_cap = FALSE, new_div293_threshold = 250e3)

```

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(dtplyr)  # for data.table

new_sample_file_1718 %>%
  mutate(Taxable_Income_decile = ntile(Taxable_Income, 10)) %>%
  group_by(Taxable_Income_decile) %>%
  summarise(`Average increase in tax` = round(mean(new_revenue - prv_revenue), 2)) %>%
  arrange(Taxable_Income_decile) %>%
  kable
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
new_sample_file_1718 %>%
  mutate(Taxable_Income_decile = ntile(Taxable_Income, 10)) %>%
  group_by(Taxable_Income_decile) %>%
  summarise(`Average increase in tax` = mean(new_revenue - prv_revenue)) %>%
  arrange(Taxable_Income_decile) %>%
  #
  mutate(`Taxable income decile` = factor(Taxable_Income_decile)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Taxable income decile`, y = `Average increase in tax`)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  
  # cosmetic:
  scale_y_continuous(label = grattan_dollar) + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", angle = 90, margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, "lines")))
```








# Performance of project

To test the performance of our projection, we consider the projection of the 2012-13 sample file by one year with the actual 2013-14 sample file.

```{r}
sample_file_1314_projected <- 
  sample_file_1213 %>%
  copy %>%
  mutate(WEIGHT = 50) %>%
  project(h = 1L,
          fy.year.of.sample.file = "2012-13",
          .recalculate.inflators = TRUE) %>%
  .[]
```


```{r}
data.table(the_source = c("Actual",
                          "Projected"),
           n_persons = c(nrow(sample_file_1314) * 50,
                         sum(sample_file_1314_projected$WEIGHT)), 
           avg_Taxable_Income = c(mean(sample_file_1314$Taxable_Income),
                                  mean(sample_file_1314_projected$Taxable_Income)),
           avg_Sw = c(mean(sample_file_1314$Sw_amt),
                      mean(sample_file_1314_projected$Sw_amt))
) %>% 
  melt.data.table(id.vars = "the_source") %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  mutate(value_rel = value / first(value)) %>%
  # dcast.data.table(variable ~ the_source) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value_rel, fill = the_source)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = comma(round(value))),
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
            hjust = 1.02) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

```{r}
conf_int_of_t.test <- function(variable){
  t_test <- t.test(sample_file_1314[[variable]],
                   sample_file_1314_projected[[variable]])
  
  data.table(var = variable,
             conf.low = t_test$conf.int[1],
             conf.high = t_test$conf.int[2],
             p.value = t_test$p.value)
}

c("Sw_amt",
  "Net_rent_amt",
  "Net_CG_amt",
  "Tot_inc_amt",
  "Tot_ded_amt",
  "Taxable_Income") %>%
  lapply(conf_int_of_t.test) %>%
  rbindlist %>%
  .[, list(var, conf.low, conf.high, p.value)] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = var,
             ymin = conf.low,
             ymax = conf.high,
             color = p.value > 0.05)) + 
  geom_errorbar() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

## Years not in sample files

Other tests can be found in the `tests/` folder to compare the tax collections in those years.
